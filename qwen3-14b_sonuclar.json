Then \"hiç beğenmedim\" translates to \"didn't like it at all.\" The action of purchasing based on reviews might suggest a positive intent initially, but the outcome is negative because they didn't like the product.\n\nThe sentiment here is clearly negative.

The user says they didn't find the fabric quality good (\"kaliteli bulmadım\"), which is a negative statement. Then they mention that it didn't look like in the picture (\"resimdeki gibi durmadı\"), indicating disappointment with the product's appearance compared to expectations. Finally, \"beğenemedim\" means they couldn't like it, which is another negative expression.\n\nThere's no positive language here. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with both the quality and the appearance of the fabric.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the text \"hesaplı bir ürün\" and wants a sentiment analysis. First, I need to understand what \"hesaplı\" means here. In Turkish, \"hesaplı\" can mean something like calculated or shrewd, but in the context of a product, it might be used differently.\n\nHmm, maybe the user is referring to a product that's cost-effective or well-priced? But \"hesaplı\" can also have a negative connotation, implying that the product is cheap or not worth the price. Wait, but the example given for neutral was \"fiyatına göre okey,\" which translates to \"okay for the price.\" So maybe \"hesaplı\" here is similar, suggesting that the product is reasonably priced.\n\nBut I need to be careful. If someone says \"hesaplı bir ürün,\" are they being positive or negative? If it's neutral, then the label would be NEUTRAL. But if there's a slight negative tone, maybe NEGATIVE. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The word itself doesn't have an inherently positive or negative meaning; it depends on the context.\n\nLooking at the examples again: \"Fiyatına göre okey\" was neutral. So if \"hesaplı\" is similar in that it's about value for money, maybe it's neutral. But I should check if there's any common usage where \"hesaplı\" is more positive or negative. Maybe in some contexts, it could be seen as a positive trait, like being practical or economical. However, sometimes it can imply that the product is cheap, which might be negative.\n\nBut since the user hasn't provided more context, and the example for neutral was about price, I think \"hesaplı bir ürün\" is likely neutral here. The user might be stating a fact without strong positive or negative sentiment. So the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user wrote, \"kokusu güzel ama alırken bu kadar küçük olduğuna dikkkat etmemiştim.\" Translating that to English: \"The smell is nice but I didn't notice how small it was when I bought it.\" \n\nFirst, the positive part is \"kokusu güzel\" which means the scent is good. That's a positive sentiment. However, the second part starts with \"ama\" which is \"but,\" indicating a contrast. The user mentions not noticing the size when purchasing, which seems like a negative point because they might be disappointed that it's smaller than expected.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the overall sentiment is more positive, negative, or neutral. The text has both positive and negative elements. But in such cases where there's a mix, the dominant emotion usually dictates the label. However, sometimes if both are equally weighted, it might be neutral. \n\nBut here, the positive comment is about the scent, which is a specific aspect, while the negative part is about the size, which could affect overall satisfaction. Since the user is pointing out a drawback despite liking the smell, the overall sentiment might lean more towards negative because the disappointment in the product's size could outweigh the positive aspect of the scent. However, it's not extremely negative; it's more of a mixed feeling. But according to the rules, if there's a mix, but one part is stronger, maybe it's neutral? Wait, no. The guidelines say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. If there are both positive and negative elements without clear dominance, it might be neutral. However, sometimes the presence of a complaint (negative) even with a positive note can make the overall sentiment negative. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expressing that despite the good smell, they were surprised by the size, which could be a negative experience. So the main sentiment here is more on the negative side because the unexpected small size is a drawback. Therefore, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

These phrases indicate dissatisfaction. The user is comparing the actual product to a photo, expecting it to match, but it's not meeting their expectations. The use of \"hiç beğenmedim\" is a strong negative statement.\n\nNext, checking for any positive or neutral elements. There's no positive language here.

The emoji 👎🏼 is a negative sign.\n\nThe user is clearly frustrated because the battery life is so bad that even a short use drains it.

It doesn't express strong positive or negative feelings. The person is neither highly satisfied nor dissatisfied. \n\nLooking at the rules, the possible labels are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.

So, sticking strictly to the text given, it's neutral. \n\nAlso, checking the examples: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled NEUTRAL, which is similar.

But then they mention \"ama oyle uzun süre nem vermiyor,\" which translates to \"but it doesn't provide moisture for a long time.\" That's a negative point.\n\nNext, the user says, \"ya benim cildim cooooooookkk kuru anında emiyor ya da krem öyle abartıldığı kadar değil. bilemiyorum.\" Breaking this down: \"My skin is super dry, it doesn't absorb immediately or the cream isn't as exaggerated as claimed.

The initial part is positive about effectiveness, but the latter parts express dissatisfaction with moisture duration and absorption. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a mix, we usually go with the dominant emotion. But looking at the structure, the user starts with a positive note but then lists negatives.

Then \"paketlemesi iyiydi\" translates to the packaging was good, another positive remark. Both parts are positive.\n\nAre there any negative words or neutral terms here? The words used are all positive: \"hızlı\" (fast), \"iyi\" (good). No negative words like \"kötü\" (bad) or \"memnun değil\" (not satisfied). \n\nSo combining both parts, the overall sentiment is positive.

The user starts with a positive note by saying the product is good (\"güzel\"). However, they follow up with a negative comment about the size being too small (\"bayağı küçük geldi boyutu\"). \n\nNow, the challenge is determining whether the overall sentiment is more positive, negative, or neutral. Since there are both positive and negative aspects mentioned, but no clear dominance of one over the other, it might lean towards neutral. However, sometimes in such cases, if the negative aspect is a significant drawback, it could tip the scale to negative.\n\nBut looking at the structure, the user acknowledges the product's quality positively but points out a specific issue with size. The use of \"fakat\" (but) introduces a contrast, which often indicates that the second part is a criticism. However, since both aspects are present without one being overwhelmingly stronger, the overall sentiment might be neutral because it's a mix of positive and negative elements without clear dominance.\n\nI should also consider if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but in this case, it seems straightforward. The user is expressing satisfaction with the product's quality but disappointment with the size.

The user mentions they've been using the product for a month and haven't seen any benefits yet. That sounds negative. Words like \"yok\" (no) and the context of not seeing any benefits after a period of use usually indicate dissatisfaction.\n\nBut wait, there's a part that says \"Çok Yakıyo.\" Maybe that's a typo or slang? If it's supposed to be \"Yakıyor,\" which means \"is burning\" or \"is working,\" but even then, the rest of the sentence is negative. The user might be saying that despite using it for a month, there's no benefit, so the overall sentiment is negative.\n\nI should check if there are any positive words. The only possible positive word here is \"Çok\" which means \"very,\" but it's paired with \"Yakıyo\" which might not be positive. Alternatively, maybe \"Yakıyo\" is a brand name or a term I'm not familiar with.

The text is: \"Ruj dudak cizgilerine giriyor homojen dagılım gibi durmuyor ama kolay bir sürümü var\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user is talking about a lipstick (\"ruj\") and its application on the lips (\"dudak cizgilerine giriyor\"). They mention that it doesn't spread evenly (\"homojen dagılım gibi durmuyor\"), which sounds negative. However, they also say there's an easy version (\"kolay bir sürümü var\"), which could be positive.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The first part is a complaint about the product not applying smoothly, which is negative. But then there's a mention of an easy version, which might be a positive note. However, the main issue here seems to be the uneven application, which is a significant drawback. The presence of an easy version might be a mitigating factor but doesn't necessarily outweigh the negative aspect. \n\nIn Turkish sentiment analysis, even if there's a positive part, if the overall experience is more negative, the label should be NEGATIVE. The user is pointing out a problem with the product's performance, which is a strong indicator of dissatisfaction. The mention of an easy version might be a secondary point but doesn't change the primary negative sentiment about the application.\n\nSo, considering the main complaint and the secondary positive note, the dominant sentiment here is likely NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user is expressing satisfaction with the speed and punctuality of the delivery.\n\nThen there's \"Teşekkür ederim,\" which is a direct expression of gratitude. That's a strong indicator of a positive sentiment. There's no negative language here, just appreciation for the service received.\n\nI should make sure there's no sarcasm or hidden meaning. The sentence structure is straightforward and polite. No words that could be interpreted as negative.

Maybe they meant \"cilt\" which means skin in Turkish. So \"toparlaması\" could be related to healing or repairing. So the phrase might be \"skin repair is good\" or \"the skin healing effect is nice.\" That's definitely positive.\n\nPutting it all together, both parts of the sentence are positive.

Translating that to English, it means something like \"Don't have high expectations, it's manageable but...\" The phrase starts with a warning not to have high expectations, which might indicate some negative sentiment. However, the second part says \"idare eder\" which means \"it's manageable\" or \"can be handled\", suggesting a more neutral or even slightly positive outlook. The use of \"ama\" (but) introduces a contrast, so there's a mix here.\n\nThe user is advising others not to expect too much, implying that the situation might not meet high expectations, but also stating that it can be managed. This seems like a balanced view. There's no strong negative language, just a caution and a note that it's manageable. So maybe neutral? But wait, \"beklentiyi yüksek tutmayın\" could be seen as a negative because it's telling people not to expect something good. However, the second part is more about manageability rather than positivity or negativity.\n\nHmm, but in sentiment analysis, sometimes the overall tone matters. If someone says \"don't have high expectations, it's manageable\", they might be trying to set realistic expectations, which could lean towards neutral. There's no explicit positive or negative words here. The key is whether the sentiment is clearly positive, negative, or neutral. Since there's a mix but not strong indicators either way, I think \"NEUTRAL\" is the best fit here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

They expected certain results from a product (probably a hair care one) but didn't achieve them. Words like \"övüldüğü kadar\" (as much as it was praised) and \"maalesef\" (unfortunately) indicate negative feelings. The mention of not seeing any improvement in their hair's condition supports the negative sentiment.\n\nHowever, there's a part where they say \"Her saçın ihtiyacı farklı tabii ürünü kullanmadan bilemezsiniz bunu maalesef.\" This might seem like a neutral statement about individual differences, but combined with the previous disappointment, it still leans negative.

The user mentions two negative outcomes: kabarttı (made frizzy) and sertleştirdi (hardened). The use of \"galiba\" (maybe) adds some uncertainty, but the overall sentiment seems to be more negative because the product caused a problem despite the good smell.\n\nSo even though there's a positive aspect, the negatives are significant enough to make the overall sentiment negative.

The word \"fazla\" here is negative because it's indicating excessiveness, which is usually seen as a bad thing in this context. People might find an overly strong scent unpleasant.

But then they mention \"ferahlık hissi güzel\" – a feeling of refreshment is good. \n\nSo there's a mix here. The first part is negative because they didn't see an effect, but the second part is positive about the feeling. However, in sentiment analysis, we often look at the overall tone.

Not seeing an immediate effect could be negative, but the positive feeling might balance it.

I need to analyze the sentiment here.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The user mentions that the size they ordered was an L, but it's as big as an XXL. That seems like a positive point because they might be happy with the sizing. Then they add \"kışlık üstelik\" which translates to something like \"and it's winter wear\". Wait, maybe they're saying that even though it's a large size, it's suitable for winter? Or is there a negative connotation here?\n\nWait, \"kışlık\" means winter clothing, but the user might be implying that the item is too big and bulky, making it unsuitable for winter. But I'm not sure. Let me check again.\n\nThe sentence structure: \"Kalıbı çok büyük L aldım XXL gibi kışlık üstelik.\" So they ordered an L, which turned out to be as big as an XXL. The part after \"üstelik\" (which means \"and also\") is \"kışlık\". Maybe they're saying that the size is so large it's like an XXL, and even though it's for winter, that's a good thing? Or maybe they're complaining that it's too big for winter?\n\nAlternatively, could there be a typo or misunderstanding in the sentence structure? If \"kışlık\" is part of the product description, but the user is pointing out that the size is incorrect. However, without more context, it's tricky.\n\nBut looking at the keywords: \"çok büyük\" (very big), \"XXL gibi\" (like XXL). These are positive adjectives if they're happy with the size. But sometimes in Turkish reviews, people might use sarcasm. For example, saying something is too big could be negative. However, the user didn't express dissatisfaction here. They just stated the facts about the size.\n\nSo considering that, the sentiment seems neutral because they are just describing the situation without expressing a clear positive or negative emotion.

But then they mention they're new to using it for lengthening, so they can't comment yet. That part is neutral because they're not sure yet. \n\nBut the main point here is that the user didn't find any additional benefits compared to regular products. The overall sentiment seems more negative than neutral. However, the second sentence introduces uncertainty, which might lean towards neutral. But since the first part is a clear negative statement, maybe it's still negative. Wait, but the user isn't explicitly saying they're unhappy; they're just stating facts. They didn't say it's bad, just that there's no difference and no extra effect. So maybe it's more neutral because they're not expressing strong positive or negative emotions. The uncertainty part also adds to neutrality. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the first part is a comparison where the product doesn't stand out. That could be seen as negative. However, the user isn't necessarily dissatisfied; they might just be stating that it's average. But in sentiment analysis, if there's no positive or negative words, it's neutral. The key here is whether the statements are positive, negative, or neutral. \"No difference\" and \"no extra effect\" could be seen as negative, but maybe not strongly enough to label as negative. Since they're not expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction beyond stating facts, perhaps it's neutral. But I need to check the rules again.\n\nThe user instructions say that if there's no clear positive or negative sentiment, it should be neutral. The example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is a neutral statement. In this case, the user isn't expressing strong feelings but rather stating their observations and uncertainty. So maybe the correct label here is NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The sentence starts with a positive note about the moisturizing being good. However, the second part uses \"fakat\" which means \"but,\" indicating a contrast. The user is warning against expecting too much change, which could be seen as a negative point.\n\nBut wait, the overall sentiment depends on the balance between the positive and negative parts. The first part is positive, but the second part is a caution. However, in product reviews, sometimes pointing out limitations isn't necessarily negative; it might be neutral. But here, the user is saying that while the moisturizing is good, there's a caveat. \n\nHmm, the key is whether the overall sentiment leans more towards positive, negative, or neutral. The initial part is positive, but the second part introduces a limitation. However, since the user isn't strongly criticizing the product but just pointing out a limitation, maybe it's neutral. Alternatively, if the main point is that despite being good, there's a drawback, it might be slightly negative.\n\nBut according to the rules, I need to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The presence of both positive and negative elements could lead to NEUTRAL. However, sometimes in such cases, if the positive aspect is more emphasized, it might still be positive. But here, the cautionary note might tip it towards neutral because the user is not overly satisfied but also not entirely dissatisfied.\n\nWait, another angle: The user acknowledges a positive feature (moisturizing is good) but warns against expecting too much change. This could be seen as a mixed sentiment, but since the instructions require choosing one label, NEUTRAL might be appropriate here because it's neither strongly positive nor negative.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user starts with \"Kalıcılık süper\" which translates to \"Durability is super\" or \"The durability is great.\" That's a positive statement.\n\nBut then there's an \"ama\" which means \"but,\" indicating a contrast. The rest of the sentence talks about the material being too soft (\"uç çok yumuşak\"), leading to issues like stretching quickly and becoming thin (\"hemen genleşiyor kalın çekiliyo\"). These are negative points.\n\nSo, the user is expressing both positive and negative aspects. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a mix but one part is more dominant or the overall sentiment is neutral because of the contrast, it might be labeled as NEUTRAL. But I need to check if the negatives outweigh the positives here.\n\nThe initial praise about durability is countered by the problems with the material's softness causing stretching and thinning. Since the user mentions both pros and cons, but doesn't have a clear overall positive or negative sentiment, it might lean towards NEUTRAL.

Wait, actually, \"el kadar\" literally means \"hand-sized,\" but the user wrote \"el kadar çok minik,\" which is \"as small as a thumb.\" Wait, \"minik\" means tiny or very small.

However, depending on the product type, maybe it's intended to be small. But without more context, the comparison to something very small (a thumb) is likely a negative remark.

The user's example for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey,\" which means \"Okay considering the price.\" That's neutral because it's a compromise. Similarly, \"idare eder\" could be similar, indicating that while it's not bad, it's not great either. \n\nBut wait, sometimes \"idare eder\" can be used in a more negative way, like implying that something is just tolerable. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The user's examples show that neutral is for situations where there's a mix of factors, like price affecting the perception. \n\nIn this case, since \"idare eder\" is a common expression that can lean towards neutral or slightly negative depending on context, but in the absence of strong positive or negative words, it might be safest to label it as NEUTRAL. The user's examples don't have any instances where \"idare eder\" was used, so I need to rely on the general meaning. \n\nAlternatively, if the user considers \"idare eder\" as a mild negative, but since the instructions say to use the given labels and not assume, maybe NEUTRAL is better here.

Then there's \"Lıght rengi\" which might be a typo for \"Light rengi\" (light color). The phrase \"en ideal renk\" translates to \"the most ideal color,\" which is also positive. The last part \"buğday tenliyseniz\" means \"if you have wheat-colored skin.\" \n\nPutting it all together, the user is saying that the light color is the most ideal for someone with wheat-colored skin. The use of \"güzell\" and \"ideal\" are clearly positive terms. There's no negative language here, just a recommendation based on skin tone. Even though there's a typo in \"Lıght,\" it doesn't affect the sentiment. So the overall sentiment is positive.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The user wrote: \"valla şimdilik hoşuma gitti umarım yaza kadar daha hoş bir görünüme destek olur\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the sentiment here. The word \"hoşuma gitti\" translates to \"it pleased me\" or \"I liked it,\" which is positive. However, there's a conditional part: \"umarım yaza kadar daha hoş bir görünüme destek olur\" meaning \"I hope it continues to support a more pleasant appearance until summer.\" The user is expressing a current positive feeling but also some uncertainty about the future.\n\nNow, considering the rules. The task is to classify the text into POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The main sentiment here seems positive because the immediate reaction is favorable. However, there's a hope for improvement, which might introduce some ambiguity. But since the current feeling is positive and the future part is a wish without negative connotations, the overall sentiment should still be positive. \n\nI need to make sure not to overcomplicate it.

Then \"gerçekten çok güzel\" means \"really very beautiful\" or \"truly very nice.\" Both parts of the sentence are filled with positive language. There's no negative words here, and the overall tone is enthusiastic and appreciative. So the sentiment should be clearly positive.

Renkleri inanılmaz soluk , diğer markalara göre oldukça belirsiz işaretleme yapıyor pişman oldum aldığıma..\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user is talking about colors being \"inanılmaz soluk\" which translates to \"incredibly pale\" or \"surprisingly light.\" Then they mention that compared to other brands, the marking is \"belirsiz,\" meaning unclear or indistinct. They also say they're \"pişman oldum aldığıma,\" which means they regret their purchase.\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"soluk\" (pale) might be neutral or slightly negative depending on context, but here it's paired with \"inanılmaz\" (incredibly), which could be positive. However, the next part about the marking being unclear and the regret (\"pişman\") are clearly negative sentiments. The comparison to other brands using \"belirsiz işaretleme\" suggests dissatisfaction.\n\nSo even though there's a positive adjective, the overall sentiment is dominated by the negative aspects mentioned. The user is expressing disappointment with the product's quality compared to others and regret over the purchase. Therefore, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The key points are negative: \"ideal bir südyen değil\" (not an ideal bra), \"gevşiyor\" (loosening), \"südyen yokmuş gibi oluyor\" (feels like there's no bra), and \"çok beğenmedim\" (didn't like it much). These are all negative indicators. Even though there's a mention of \"büyük gögüsleri olan için\" (for those with large breasts), that's more of a context rather than a positive statement.

The user wrote: \"Aşırı bol büyük bunu göze alarak sipariş verin.\" Translating that to English, it means something like \"Overly abundant large, take this into account when placing an order.\" \n\nHmm, the words \"aşırı bol\" mean \"excessively abundant,\" which could be positive if they're talking about quantity, but maybe negative if it's too much. Then \"büyük\" is \"large,\" which might refer to size or portion. The phrase \"bunu göze alarak\" translates to \"taking this into account,\" suggesting that the user wants the recipient to consider the abundance and size when ordering.\n\nBut wait, the context isn't clear. Are they saying the product is too big or too much? If it's a positive aspect, like having more than enough, then it might be positive.

Then there's \"ince\" meaning \"thin,\" which could be neutral on its own, but in this context, it's probably used to emphasize the lack of quality. The phrase \"hiç kaliteli değil\" means \"not at all quality,\" which is a strong negative statement.\n\nLooking at the rules, I need to assign one of the labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there are multiple negative adjectives and the overall sentiment is clearly expressing dissatisfaction, the label should be NEGATIVE. There's no ambiguity here; the user is clearly unhappy with the product's quality. No need for a neutral label because even though \"ince\" might be neutral, the other terms overpower it.

The user mentions struggling for a month, which sounds negative. However, there's no explicit expression of happiness or sadness. They might be neutral because they're just stating a fact without strong positive or negative emotions.

However, the user isn't using strong negative words like \"zehirlendim\" (I got poisoned) or \"harika\" (amazing).

However, the second part says \"nemlendiriyor bilginiz olsun.\" The word \"nemlendiriyor\" translates to \"moisturizes\" or \"makes moist,\" but in this context, it might be negative depending on the product.

However, sometimes in such cases, if the negative part is a significant con, it could be negative.

However, the next part says \"boyut olarak küçük\" meaning \"small in size.\" That might be a negative point because some people prefer larger sizes. But then they add \"fakat çok uzun süre kullanılır,\" which translates to \"but lasts a very long time.\" The word \"fakat\" is \"but,\" indicating a contrast. So even though the size is small, the longevity is a positive aspect.\n\nNow, considering the overall sentiment. The user starts with a strong positive adjective, mentions a potential negative (small size), but then counters it with a positive about lasting long. In such cases, the positive aspects might outweigh the negative. However, sometimes if there's a contrast, it could be neutral. But here, the initial praise is strong, and the negative point is mitigated by another positive. So I think the overall sentiment is still positive. The user is highlighting the product's effectiveness despite its size. Therefore, the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Translating that to English, it means \"When you wipe, a trace remains.\" The emoji used is a winking face, which usually conveys something sly or mischievous.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment. The phrase itself is neutral in terms of positive or negative. It's stating a fact about wiping leaving a trace. However, the context might matter. If someone is talking about cleaning and being unable to remove something completely, it could be slightly negative. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe emoji adds a layer of nuance. A winking face can imply that the person is aware of the trace but not bothered by it, or maybe even finding it amusing. That leans towards a neutral or slightly positive tone. However, if the situation is about something negative like a stain or a mistake, the sentiment might shift.\n\nBut since there's no explicit positive or negative language here, just a statement and an emoji that's more about attitude than emotion, the safest label is NEUTRAL. The user isn't expressing clear satisfaction or dissatisfaction; they're just making an observation with a bit of cheekiness.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

My task is to analyze this and determine the sentiment label.\n\nFirst, I need to check the keywords. The word \"güzel\" means \"nice\" or \"good,\" which is a positive adjective. There's no negative language here, just a straightforward compliment about the product. The structure is simple, so there's no ambiguity. \n\nI should make sure there are no hidden negatives or sarcasm. But in Turkish, if someone says \"güzel bir ürün,\" it's usually a genuine positive statement. No context suggests otherwise. \n\nComparing to the examples given: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" (Positive), \"Zehirlendim.\" (Negative), \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (Neutral). The example for positive uses a strong positive adjective, similar to \"güzel.\" So this should be POSITIVE.\n\nNo need to consider neutral here because there's no indication of neutrality or mixed feelings. The user is clearly expressing satisfaction.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

So the person is saying that the L size they bought is very tight.\n\nNow, analyzing the sentiment. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product fit. They expected an L, which is typically a larger size, but it's too tight. This indicates a negative experience because the product didn't meet their expectations.

However, the main points are about the product's volume being too small for the price, which indicates dissatisfaction.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the text: \"yani ortalama fiyat uygun\". I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Yani\" is like \"so\" or \"meaning,\" used to introduce a point. Then \"ortalama fiyat\" means \"average price.\" The last part is \"uygun,\" which translates to \"appropriate\" or \"suitable.\" So putting it all together: \"So the average price is appropriate.\"\n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The user is stating that the average price is suitable, which sounds positive. But wait, maybe they're being neutral? Because \"uygun\" can be neutral depending on context. However, in many cases, when someone says a price is appropriate, it's a positive remark. They might be implying that the price isn't too high, which is a good thing.\n\nBut I should check if there's any negative connotation here. The word \"ortalama\" (average) could suggest that it's not exceptional, just average. So maybe the user is being neutral because they're saying it's average and suitable, not necessarily positive or negative. However, in some contexts, saying something is appropriate can be a positive statement.\n\nHmm, but looking at the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. That translates to \"Okay for the price,\" which is similar. So maybe when the user says \"uygun\" (suitable), it's more neutral because they're just stating that the price is appropriate without strong positive or negative emotions.\n\nWait, but in Turkish, \"uygun\" can sometimes carry a positive tone. However, in this case, since the user is just stating that the average price is suitable, without any additional context like \"it's better than expected\" or \"too high,\" it might be more neutral. The example given by the user for \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was NEUTRAL, so following that logic, this should also be NEUTRAL.\n\nBut I need to make sure. If someone says \"fiyat uygun\" (the price is suitable), that's usually a positive statement. However, in the example provided by the user, they labeled \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" as neutral. So maybe when it's just stating that something is appropriate without any comparison or strong sentiment, it's considered neutral.\n\nIn this case, the user says \"ortalama fiyat uygun\" (the average price is suitable). Since they're not expressing enthusiasm or dissatisfaction, but just stating a fact that the price is suitable, it leans towards neutral. Therefore, the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user mentions that they had high expectations (\"o kadar çok bekledim\") but the product didn't meet them. Also, \"desteksiz\" (unsupported) might refer to lack of support or features. \n\nThen there's \"Çok mahcup oldum\" (I felt very embarrassed), which shows a strong negative emotion.

The user might be neutral because they're unsure. However, the initial part about expecting an effect if used continuously could be seen as slightly positive. But since the conclusion is uncertain, it might balance out to neutral. \n\nAlternatively, the use of \"bence\" (in my opinion) and the uncertainty at the end might make it more neutral.

Then \"paranız ziyan olmayın\" means \"don't let your money be wasted,\" reinforcing the idea that buying this product is not advisable. \n\nNext part: \"far değil\" which is \"not expensive\" or \"not costly.\" That could be positive, but in context, it's probably used to say that even though it's not expensive, you shouldn't buy it.

The example given for similar mixed sentiments was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is NEUTRAL. Here, the user is saying it's not bad and a good product for the price. So maybe the overall sentiment is positive because they're satisfied with the product considering the price. But there's also a negative aspect about the scent. However, in the example provided earlier, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. In this case, the user is more positive, so perhaps it should be POSITIVE. Alternatively, if the negatives and positives balance out, maybe NEUTRAL.\n\nBut looking at the examples again: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" (POSITIVE), \"Zehirlendim.\" (NEGATIVE), \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (NEUTRAL). The current text has both negative and positive elements but ends with a positive statement about the product's value. Since the user is not overly negative, just pointing out a minor flaw but overall satisfied, it might lean towards POSITIVE. However, if there's a balance between negative and positive, maybe NEUTRAL. But in the example where \"fiyatına göre okey\" was neutral, here the user says \"iyi bir ürün\", which is more positive than just \"okey\". So perhaps this should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The user mentions \"salaş\" which means luxurious or fancy, so that's positive. But then they say \"beden bol oldugu için\" meaning the size was too big, leading them to return the product. That part is negative because returning a product usually indicates dissatisfaction.\n\nNow, the challenge is determining the overall sentiment. The user starts with a positive adjective but ends up returning the item due to the size issue. However, in Turkish, sometimes the structure can be tricky. The phrase \"çok, salaş bir kalıp\" might be emphasizing that the product was too luxurious, which could be a negative if it's not what they expected. But \"salaş\" is generally positive.\n\nBut the main reason for returning is the size being too big (\"beden bol\"), which is a clear negative point.

The heart indicates affection, thumbs up is approval, and applause suggests praise.

The user wrote: \"hızlı teslim edildi beklediğimden büyüktü. büyük kısmı gıcırdıyor ama kücük kısmında sorun yok\". \n\nFirst, I'll break it down into parts. The first part is \"hızlı teslim edildi\" which means \"delivered quickly.\" That's a positive point.\n\nNext, \"beklediğimden büyüktü\" translates to \"bigger than expected.\" That's also positive because the product was larger than anticipated, which might be seen as a good thing.\n\nThen there's \"büyük kısmı gıcırdıyor\" meaning \"the large part is noisy\" or \"crackling,\" which sounds negative. It could indicate a defect or poor quality.\n\nHowever, the last part says \"küçük kısmında sorun yok\" which means \"no problem in the small part.\" This is neutral because it's stating that at least part of it works fine.\n\nNow, considering all parts: there are both positive and negative elements. The delivery was fast and the size was good, but there's an issue with a large portion. However, the user also mentions that a small part doesn't have problems. \n\nIn sentiment analysis, when there are mixed sentiments, sometimes it's neutral if the positives and negatives balance out. But here, the negative aspect (the large part being faulty) might outweigh the positives unless the user is satisfied with the overall product despite the issue. However, the presence of a problem could lean towards negative. Alternatively, since they mentioned both positive and negative aspects without a clear conclusion, it might be neutral.\n\nBut I need to check if the negatives are significant enough to make the overall sentiment negative. The fact that \"büyük kısmı\" (the large part) is problematic suggests a major issue, which would likely make the sentiment negative. However, the user also points out a positive aspect and a neutral one. But in many cases, when there's a clear problem mentioned, even if other aspects are good, the overall sentiment might be negative.\n\nWait, but maybe the user is trying to say that despite the noise in the large part, the small part works. However, the main issue here is the malfunctioning of the large portion, which could be a significant drawback. So the sentiment might lean towards negative because the product has a major defect. But I should also consider if the user is satisfied overall. Since they didn't explicitly say it's bad or good, but mentioned both positives and negatives, maybe neutral.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. In some cases, mixed sentiments can be neutral. However, the presence of a problem (the large part being faulty) might tip it towards negative. But I need to see if the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's quality despite the fast delivery and size. The key here is that the main function of the product (assuming it's something like an electronic device or appliance) having a significant part not working would be a major issue, leading to a negative sentiment.\n\nAlternatively, if the product is something where the noise isn't critical, but the user is just mentioning it as a minor inconvenience. But without more context, I have to go by the text given. The mention of \"gıcırdıyor\" (crackling) could be a defect, which would be negative. However, the user also mentions that the small part doesn't have issues. So maybe they're trying to say that it's mostly okay except for one part. But the fact that the large portion is problematic might still make the overall sentiment negative.\n\nI think in this case, the dominant sentiment is negative because the main issue (the large part being faulty) is a significant problem. Even though there are positives and neutrals, the negative aspect is more impactful.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The key parts are \"Kullanmadım daha\" (I haven't used it yet) and \"gereksiz bişi\" (unnecessary stuff). The first part indicates that the person hasn't used the product or service, which might mean they can't provide a direct experience. However, the second part uses \"gereksiz,\" which is negative, implying that the item is not needed or useful.\n\nBut wait, the user hasn't used it yet. So their opinion is based on prior knowledge or expectations rather than actual use. The word \"gereksiz\" is strong and negative. Even though they haven't used it, they're still expressing a negative view about its necessity. \n\nIn sentiment analysis, even if someone hasn't used a product, their statement can still be classified. Since they're calling it unnecessary, that's a negative judgment. The fact that they haven't used it might make the sentiment more neutral in some contexts, but the use of \"gereksiz\" is clearly negative. \n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but the text seems straightforward.

The user wrote, \"Çok güzel bir ürün fazla para vermeye gerek yok.\" Translating that to English, it's \"A very good product, no need to pay too much.\" \n\nFirst, I notice the positive adjective \"çok güzel\" which means \"very good.\" That's a strong positive indicator. However, the second part says \"fazla para vermeye gerek yok,\" which translates to \"no need to pay too much.\" This could be interpreted as the product being overpriced or not worth the high cost.\n\nBut wait, in Turkish, when someone says \"fazla para vermeye gerek yok,\" they might mean that the price is reasonable for such a good product. It's possible they're emphasizing that despite being good, it doesn't require paying an excessive amount. So the overall sentiment here seems positive because the user is praising the product and possibly indicating that it's a good deal.\n\nAlternatively, if the user thought the product was overpriced, they might have said something like \"fazla para vermek gerekiyor\" (you have to pay too much), but in this case, it's the opposite. They're saying you don't need to pay too much for such a good product. So the sentiment is positive.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The user is clearly stating they don't like the stickiness. That's a negative feeling. There's no ambiguity here. The words used are straightforward in conveying dissatisfaction.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but Turkish doesn't use sarcasm as much as English, and the sentence is pretty direct.

            "label": "ERROR",
            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the text \"Ağır kokusu\" and wants a sentiment analysis. First, I need to understand what this phrase means in Turkish. \"Ağır\" translates to \"heavy\" or \"strong,\" and \"kokusu\" is \"smell\" or \"odor.\" So, \"Ağır kokusu\" would be something like \"Strong smell\" or \"Heavy odor.\"\n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The word \"ağır\" can have different connotations depending on context. If someone says \"ağır kokusu,\" they might be referring to a strong smell that's unpleasant. For example, if a product has a strong chemical smell, that could be negative. However, in some contexts, a strong smell might be neutral or even positive, like a strong perfume.\n\nBut without additional context, the default assumption would be that an \"ağır kokusu\" is more likely to be negative. People usually mention strong smells when they're complaining about something unpleasant. For instance, if someone says \"Bu ürünün ağır kokusu var,\" it's probably a negative comment about the product's smell.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any neutral or positive interpretations. If the context is about a fragrance or something where a strong smell is desired, it might be neutral or even positive. But since the user hasn't provided more context, I have to go with the most common interpretation.\n\nIn Turkish reviews, when someone mentions \"ağır kokusu,\" it's often in a negative sense, like a bad smell. So the sentiment here is likely NEGATIVE. But I need to make sure there's no ambiguity. Since the example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey,\" which is more about being okay with the price, maybe \"ağır kokusu\" without context is neutral? Wait, but in the examples, \"Zehirlendim.\" was negative, and \"Yemek harikaydı.\" was positive. So \"ağır kokusu\" could be neutral if it's just stating a fact, like describing a product's characteristic.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. If someone says \"Ağır kokusu var,\" they might be neutrally stating that the item has a strong smell, but without indicating whether it's good or bad. However, in many cases, mentioning a strong smell can imply a negative experience. But if there's no explicit positive or negative words, maybe it's neutral.\n\nWait, the user instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The example for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey,\" which is a neutral statement about price. So \"Ağır kokusu\" might be similar—just stating a fact without clear positive or negative sentiment. But in Turkish, sometimes even the mention of a strong smell can carry a negative connotation unless specified otherwise.\n\nI think I need to consider that without any additional context, \"ağır kokusu\" is more likely to be neutral because it's just describing an attribute. However, if the user has a history where such phrases are considered negative, but since there's no prior info, the safest label here would be NEUTRAL. But wait, in some contexts, like product reviews, a strong smell might be seen as a negative aspect. For example, if someone says \"Bu sabunun ağır kokusu var,\" they might mean it's too strong and unpleasant.\n\nBut again, without knowing the context, it's hard to say. The user might have intended it as negative, but according to strict sentiment analysis rules, if there's no explicit positive or negative words, it's neutral. However, \"ağır\" can sometimes be negative on its own. For example, \"ağır bir hastalık\" is a serious disease. So maybe \"ağır kokusu\" implies an unpleasant smell.\n\nThis is conflicting. I need to make a decision based on the examples given. The user provided that \"Zehirlendim.\" is NEGATIVE, which is clearly negative. \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is NEUTRAL because it's a neutral statement about price. \"Yemek harikaydı.\" is POSITIVE.\n\nSo for \"Ağır kokusu,\" since there's no explicit positive or negative words, but the word \"ağır\" can have a negative connotation in some contexts, maybe it's NEGATIVE. However, if it's just stating that something has a strong smell without judgment, then NEUTRAL. But in Turkish, when someone mentions an odor, especially in reviews, it's often a complaint. So I think the answer is NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The key points here are their satisfaction with the product despite not returning it. They mention that for someone with a lighter skin tone, it might be too strong, but since they're medium-toned, it's okay. However, they also note that it's very intense and rich, which could be a positive or negative depending on context.\n\nWait, the user says \"iade etmiyorum fkat çok çok açık.\" That translates to not returning it because it's too bright. But then they explain that if they were fair-skinned, the coverage would be too high. So maybe they're saying that even though it's too bright for them, others might find it too strong. However, they still aren't returning it, which could indicate some level of satisfaction despite the issues.\n\nThe overall sentiment here seems mixed but leaning towards positive because they're not returning the product and mention its intensity as a positive trait (rich, intense).

Since the user hasn't experienced the product's performance yet and is only expressing hope, the main sentiment might be more neutral.

The key words are \"hayal kırıklığı\" which means disappointment, and \"tavsiye etmiyorum\" which is not recommending. These are strong negative indicators.

First, I need to analyze this Turkish sentence to determine its sentiment.\n\nHmm, the sentence seems a bit unclear due to possible typos. Let me check the spelling. \"Bekledigimd\" might be \"Beklediğimde\" (which means \"when I expected\") but there's a typo here. Then \"n çok küçük geldi\" – maybe \"n\" is supposed to be \"ama\" or another word? Wait, \"n\" could be a typo for \"ama\" (but) or \"çok\" (very). Alternatively, it might be \"oldu\" instead of \"geldi\". But the user wrote \"geldi\", which means \"came\".\n\nPutting it together: If the intended sentence is \"Beklediğimde çok küçük geldi\", that would translate to \"When I expected, it came very small.\" The sentiment here seems negative because the person was expecting something bigger but it turned out smaller than expected. However, there's a typo in \"n\" which might be confusing. Alternatively, if \"n\" is part of another word, like \"ama çok küçük geldi\", then it would be \"But it came very small.\" Still negative.\n\nAnother possibility: The user meant \"Beklediğimde n çok küçük geldi\" where \"n\" is a typo for \"çok\". Then the sentence would be \"When I expected, it came very small.\" Again, negative sentiment. Even with typos, the overall sentiment is likely negative because the outcome was not as expected.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user wrote, \"güzel ama büyük birşey beklemeyin,\" which translates to \"It's nice but don't expect much.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The word \"güzel\" means \"nice\" or \"good,\" which is a positive term. However, the second part of the sentence says \"beyaz birşey beklemeyin,\" which translates to \"don't expect much.\" That part seems negative because it's advising against having high expectations.\n\nNow, I have to determine if the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The user starts with a positive adjective but then follows it with a cautionary note. This mixed sentiment can be tricky. In some cases, this might be considered neutral because there's both a positive and a negative element. However, sometimes the presence of a positive term can still lean the overall sentiment towards positive if the negative part is more about a warning rather than a direct complaint.\n\nBut looking at the structure, \"ama\" (but) introduces a contrast. The first part is positive, but the second part downplays expectations. This might indicate that while there's some positivity, the overall message is more cautious or even slightly negative because it's telling others not to expect much despite the initial praise. However, in sentiment analysis, sometimes the presence of any positive term can influence the label, especially if the negative part is a minor caveat.\n\nWait, but the user might be saying that it's good, but not great. So maybe neutral? Because they're acknowledging a positive aspect but also pointing out limitations. The key here is whether the overall sentiment is more positive, negative, or balanced. Since there's both a positive and a negative element without one overpowering the other, \"neutral\" might be the most accurate label here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

That's neutral. Then they say it wasn't as expected, which is negative. They also mention not liking the color and appearance, which are clear negative points.

Then \"normal boyutlara göre\" means \"compared to normal sizes,\" so maybe they're comparing it to standard sizes. The next part is \"pismanim aldigima\" – \"pismanim\" might be a typo for \"pişmanım,\" which means \"I regretted.\" So putting it all together: \"Very small compared to normal sizes, I regretted buying it.\"\n\nThe sentiment here seems negative because the person is expressing regret over the purchase due to the product being smaller than expected.

The user is talking about a product (probably a cosmetic item like lip balm or something similar) where the main issue is that the product is small, and the \"farlar\" (which might be a typo for \"fırçalar\" meaning brushes?) are not fully filled, just colored at the bottom. They ended with \"beğenmedim,\" which means \"I didn't like it.\"\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment. The user mentions two negative points: the product being small and the brushes not being properly filled. Even though they start by saying \"ürünün küçük olması dışında\" (except for the product being small), the rest of the review is about the poor quality of the brushes. The final statement \"beğenmedim\" clearly indicates dissatisfaction.\n\nSo, the sentiment here is negative. The user is expressing disappointment with the product's quality and size.

The phrase \"bir daha almam\" translates to \"I won't buy it again,\" which is a strong indicator of dissatisfaction.\n\nEven though the user didn't use explicitly negative words like \"horrible\" or \"bad,\" the implication is clear. They're expressing that the product wasn't good enough to warrant another purchase. So, this is more than just neutral; it's a negative sentiment because they're actively choosing not to repurchase.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. Could \"normal\" here be positive? Maybe in some contexts, but when paired with not buying again, it's definitely negative.

That sounds negative because the color didn't meet expectations. Then they mention washing it twice and drying it on the balcony, but it's still not wearable. That's a clear complaint about the product's condition after care, which is negative.\n\nNext, they talk about sizing issues: they wore an S but bought an M, and the waist part gathered too much.

This indicates dissatisfaction with the fit, another negative point.\n\nThe user then compares the product to other brands (armonika 'nin elbiselerinde de kol altında bu tarz çekme sorunu vardı), pointing out a similar issue in other products. However, this comparison might not necessarily be positive; it could imply that the problem is common but still a negative aspect for the user.\n\nLooking at the overall tone, there are multiple complaints about color, fit, and product quality. Even though they mention a comparison to other brands, the sentiment here is clearly negative. There's no positive feedback mentioned, just issues with the product.

The phrase \"zor geldi\" translates to \"was difficult\" or \"was hard\". In Turkish, when someone says something was difficult, it usually indicates a negative experience. The subject here is \"sürümü\", which means \"the version\" (likely referring to a software or product version). The user is expressing that using the version was challenging, which points towards dissatisfaction.\n\nNow, considering the rules: I need to classify this as either POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since the user is complaining about difficulty, it's clearly negative. There's no ambiguity here. The other options don't fit because there's no positive sentiment expressed, and it's not neutral since the user is actively stating a problem.\n\nI should make sure not to add any extra information and stick strictly to the JSON format. No markdown allowed, just plain JSON. Double-checking the example given in the instructions confirms that negative statements like this should be labeled NEGATIVE.

The user wrote, \"Akma özelliği dışında sevdim.\" Translating that to English, it would be something like \"I liked it except for the dripping feature.\" So, they're talking about a product, probably a kitchen appliance or something that involves liquid, like a kettle or a pot.\n\nThe key part here is \"sevdim,\" which means \"I liked it.\" That's positive. But then there's \"Akma özelliği dışında,\" meaning \"except for the dripping feature.\" So they have a negative point about the dripping, but overall, they still liked the product despite that. \n\nNow, the challenge is determining whether the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The user mentions both a positive aspect (liking the product) and a negative one (dripping issue). However, in many cases, if the main sentiment is positive but there's a minor complaint, the overall label might still be positive. But sometimes, if the negative point is significant enough, it could tip the scale to neutral or even negative.\n\nBut looking at the examples provided earlier: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" translates to \"It's okay for the price,\" which was labeled as NEUTRAL. In this case, the user has a positive sentiment but with a specific complaint. However, since they still liked it overall, maybe it's more positive. But in some contexts, mentioning a negative aspect might make it neutral.\n\nWait, the example given for \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was NEUTRAL because it's a balanced statement. Similarly, here, the user has a positive sentiment but with a caveat. However, the main action is \"sevdim\" which is strong positive. The negative part is just an exception. So maybe it's still POSITIVE.\n\nBut I need to be careful. If the negative aspect is a major flaw, it might change the sentiment. But since the user says they liked it despite that feature, the overall sentiment is more positive. Therefore, the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The text is in Turkish, so I need to make sure I understand the nuances correctly.\n\nThe user mentions they have an open process (açma işlemi) on their hair and that using it without cream made it feel hard (sert oldu). Then they say that shedding (dökülmesi) has decreased compared to other shampoos, but their hair didn't become soft (yumuşacık bir saç olmadı).\n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The user is talking about a product's effect on their hair. They mention both positive and negative aspects. The positive part is that shedding has reduced, which is a good thing. However, they also note that the hair didn't become soft, which is a negative point. Additionally, the initial experience of the product making their hair hard without cream is another negative aspect.\n\nBut wait, the user starts by saying there's an open process, which might be a condition or a specific use case. The main points are the reduction in shedding (positive) versus the lack of softness and the hardness when used without cream (negative). \n\nIn sentiment analysis, even if there are mixed elements, we have to determine the overall sentiment. However, the instructions say to label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since the user is pointing out both pros and cons but ends on a negative note about the hair not being soft, which might be more impactful. Alternatively, maybe the reduction in shedding is a significant positive point.\n\nBut looking at the example given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. So if there's a mix of positive and negative but no clear dominance, it could be neutral. However, in this case, the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's effectiveness in making hair soft despite some benefit in reducing shedding. \n\nI think the overall sentiment here leans more towards NEGATIVE because the main issue (hair not being soft) is a significant drawback, even though there's a minor positive point about reduced shedding. The user might be disappointed that the product didn't meet their expectations for softness.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

It's not overly positive, but it's also not negative. So the sentiment here is more neutral. Let me think of examples. If someone says \"Bu ürün fena değil,\" they might mean it's acceptable, but not excellent. \n\nLooking at the rules again: POSITIVE is for clearly positive statements, NEGATIVE for clearly negative, and NEUTRAL for anything in between or indifferent. Since \"fena değil\" isn't strongly positive or negative, it should be NEUTRAL. The user's example had \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which was neutral, so this fits similarly.

They say that the parts where the sleeves are attached are uneven and not straight, and that it's not a quality product, so they didn't like it.\n\nNow, looking at the keywords: \"duzensiz\" (uneven), \"esit değil\" (not even), \"kaliteli bir ürün değil\" (not a quality product), \"beğenmedim\" (I didn't like it). All these are negative terms. The user is clearly expressing dissatisfaction with the product's quality and construction.\n\nThe task is to classify this into POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.

The user is expressing dissatisfaction with both the product's smell and the return policy. However, there's also an element of frustration about the return process not going through. \n\nBut wait, the main issue here is the negative experience with the product's odor leading to a failed return attempt.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, translating the Turkish sentence: \"yuzu biraz kurutuyor\" means \"it's drying out a bit.\" The context here is about something being dried. Now, depending on the situation, drying could be positive or negative. For example, if it's about a fruit like apricot (which is called \"üzüm\" in Turkish?), wait no, \"yuzu\" is lemon. Wait, maybe \"yuzu\" refers to a product? Or perhaps it's a typo. Let me check again.\n\nWait, \"yuzu\" in Turkish actually means \"lemon.\" So the sentence is \"the lemon is drying out a bit.\" But why would someone mention that? Maybe they're talking about a lemon in a dish, or maybe it's part of a product description. If the lemon is drying, that might be negative if it's supposed to be fresh. Alternatively, if it's about something else, like a skincare product called \"yuzu,\" then drying could be positive if it's meant to exfoliate.\n\nBut without more context, I have to go with the most straightforward interpretation. In general, when food items are described as drying out, that's usually negative because it indicates they're not fresh. So the sentiment here is likely negative. However, there's a possibility of being neutral if the user is just stating a fact without judgment. But given that \"kurutuyor\" (drying) can be seen as a negative change in quality, I think NEGATIVE is the right label.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The phrase is clearly expressing a negative opinion. Even though there's no explicit negative word like \"kötü\" (bad), the structure \"iyi değil\" (not good) is inherently negative. The use of \"çok\" intensifies the negation, making it stronger.\n\nI should check if there's any ambiguity. In Turkish, sometimes phrases can be neutral, but in this case, the negation is clear. The user might be testing if the model recognizes that \"iyi değil\" is negative even without a strong negative word. \n\nComparing to examples given: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" is positive, \"Zehirlendim.\" is negative, and \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. The current text is similar to the second example but uses a different structure.

It seems like they're talking about a product, maybe clothing or something with color. They mention that it's not as expected (\"göründüğü gibi değil\"), which could be negative. Then they say \"açık renk geldi\" meaning the color came out light, but then there's a contrast with \"ama nude pembe yaz rengi\" which might be a specific shade of pink.\n\nThe user is expressing disappointment because the product didn't match their expectations in terms of color. Words like \"göründüğü gibi değil\" (not as it looked) and the mention of an unexpected color suggest dissatisfaction.

That would typically be a negative sentiment because the customer is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's authenticity.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another angle? Could it be neutral?

First, I need to understand what the user is saying here.\n\nBreaking it down, \"çok kücük\" means \"very small\", \"kalıbı\" is \"pattern\" or \"size\", \"küçük büyük beden\" translates to \"small large size\", and \"alın derim\" might be a typo or misphrasing. Maybe they meant \"alın derim\" as in \"I take it\" or \"I recommend\"? But the sentence structure is a bit confusing.\n\nThe user seems to be talking about a product's size, possibly clothing.

Alternatively, it might be a typo for \"alın derim\" which doesn't make much sense. \n\nConsidering the context, if someone is talking about a product's size being too small and then mentioning large sizes, it could indicate frustration or dissatisfaction. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The key words here are \"çok kücük\" (very small) and \"küçük büyük beden\" (small large size), which might be conflicting terms. \n\nThe user might be expressing a negative sentiment because they're pointing out an issue with the product's sizing. However, if it's a neutral statement about the available sizes without any emotional language, it could be neutral. But given that \"çok kücük\" is used, which emphasizes the smallness, and the mention of large size might indicate confusion or dissatisfaction.\n\nI think the sentiment here leans towards negative because the user is highlighting an issue with the product's sizing, possibly a mistake in the product description or their experience with it.

In product reviews, mentioning a negative feature like low coverage when it's expected to have more could lean towards negative. However, if the user is okay with that because it's designed for moisturizing, maybe neutral. \n\nBut in Turkish sentiment analysis, terms like \"çok az\" (very little) might indicate dissatisfaction.

Since there are both negative and positive elements without a clear dominance, \"neutral\" might be the best label.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The text is: \"Sacima tutkal suruyormusum hissi verdi komusu da yapıştirici gibi\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the meaning of this sentence. Let me break it down. \"Sacima\" might be a typo or slang; maybe they meant \"sacim\" which can mean \"stupid\" in Turkish. But I'm not sure. Then \"tutkal suruyormusum hissi verdi\" translates to something like \"gave the feeling of being covered in glue.\" The second part is \"komusu da yapıştirici gibi\" which might be \"the neighbor also like an adhesive.\"\n\nThe user is talking about a product, possibly a cosmetic or skincare item, that left a sticky residue. They mention the neighbor acting like an adhesive, which could be a metaphor for something being too clingy or not pleasant. The overall sentiment here seems negative because they're describing an unpleasant experience with the product. Words like \"tutkal\" (glue) and \"yapıştirici\" (adhesive) are used in a way that suggests discomfort or dissatisfaction.\n\nI should check if there's any positive connotation, but I don't see it. The user is expressing frustration about the product's effect. So the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Etkisi için denemeye devam edecem.\" Translating this to English helps understand the sentiment. The user says they are fond of Isparta Gül's scent but encountered an ordinary rose water smell. They mention they'll continue trying for the effect.\n\nBreaking it down: The first part is positive (\"bayılırım\" means they love it). However, the second part uses \"sıradan\" (ordinary) which is neutral or slightly negative. But the user isn't expressing strong dissatisfaction; they're just stating a fact and planning to keep trying. The overall tone isn't overly negative or positive.

In Turkish, when someone says something isn't sharp, it could be negative if they expected it to be sharp, but in this context, it's more of a neutral observation.

The first part is \"güzel paketleme uygun fiyat\" which translates to \"nice packaging and reasonable price.\" Both \"güzel\" (nice) and \"uygun\" (reasonable) are positive terms.\n\nThen there's a period, so that's the end of the first sentence. The second part starts with \"katalog fiyatına göre ucuzluğunu düşündürücü olsa da\". This translates to \"although the cheapness compared to catalog prices is thought-provoking.\" The word \"düşündürücü\" means thought-provoking, which can be neutral or slightly negative depending on context. However, in this case, it's used to express that the low price compared to the catalog is surprising or makes you think, but not necessarily negative.\n\nPutting it all together: The user is complimenting the packaging and price as good, but then mentions that the discount from the catalog price is significant enough to make someone think. However, since there's no explicit negative sentiment here, just a neutral observation about the price difference, the overall sentiment remains positive because the main points are positive.\n\nSo the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The user wrote, \"Hiç kullanmadım ağır bir kokusu var.\" Translating that to English, it means \"I haven't used it, it has a strong smell.\" \n\nFirst, the person mentions they haven't used the product. That could be neutral, but maybe there's an implication. Then they talk about a strong odor. Strong smells are often negative, especially if they're unpleasant. The user didn't explicitly say the smell is bad, but \"ağır bir kokusu\" (strong smell) can be subjective. However, in many contexts, mentioning a strong smell without positive qualifiers might lean towards negative.\n\nBut wait, maybe they're just stating a fact. If someone says a product has a strong smell, it could be neutral if they're just informing. But since the user didn't use the product and is pointing out the smell, maybe there's an underlying dissatisfaction. However, the instruction is to label based on the text without assuming. \n\nThe key here is whether \"ağır bir kokusu\" is negative. In Turkish, \"ağır koku\" can mean a strong or unpleasant odor. If it's just stating the presence of a smell without indicating it's bad, maybe neutral. But often in reviews, mentioning an unwanted characteristic like a strong smell is considered negative. \n\nLooking at the example given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (Price-wise, okay.) was labeled neutral. So if the user says something that's a drawback but not explicitly negative, it might be neutral. However, if the context implies dissatisfaction, maybe negative. But the instruction says to base on the text only.\n\nSo, the user hasn't used the product and mentions a strong smell. The strong smell is a negative aspect, so even though they didn't use it, pointing out a negative feature would make it NEGATIVE. Alternatively, if they're just stating a fact without judgment, maybe neutral.

Then they mention \"koruması çok iyi\" – \"the protection is very good.\" So that's another positive point. The second part says \"cildimi asla yağlı göstermiyor\" – \"it never makes my skin look oily.\" This is also a positive statement because the user is happy that the product isn't making their skin oily.\n\nPutting it all together, there are multiple positive sentiments here.

The key words here are \"pahalı,\" which is negative. When someone says a price is expensive, it's usually an expression of dissatisfaction or negative feeling towards the price. Even though there's no explicit negative word like \"kötü\" or \"memnun değilim,\" the context of complaining about high prices is clearly negative.\n\nI should check if there's any ambiguity. The sentence is straightforward. There's no sarcasm or mixed sentiments here. The user is directly pointing out that the price is too high, which is a clear indicator of a negative sentiment.

They mention \"nemlendirmesi\" (moisturizer) and say it's good for writing (maybe a typo? Perhaps \"yazmak için\" instead of \"yaz için\"?), and that it slightly revives the face.\n\nLooking at the sentiment, there's a mix. The user is dissatisfied with the current price compared to when they bought it, which is negative. However, they mention positive aspects about the product's effect on the skin.

The word \"harika\" is clearly positive. There's no negative language here. The user is expressing a favorable opinion about the smell.

The word \"çok\" means \"very\" in Turkish, which usually indicates a strong sentiment. Then there's \"uyguna\", which can be a bit tricky. Wait, maybe it's a typo? Could it be \"uygun\" (suitable) or \"ugra\" (to go)? But the user wrote \"uyguna\". Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the structure: \"çok uyguna almıstım\". The verb here is \"almak\", which means \"to take\" or \"to get\". So maybe they meant \"I took it very suitable\"? That doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, could there be a spelling mistake? Maybe \"uygun\" instead of \"uyguna\"? If that's the case, then \"çok uygun almıştım\" would mean \"I had taken it very suitable\", but still not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"uygundan\" (from suitable) but the user wrote \"uyguna\". This is confusing. Let me check if there's a common phrase or typo here. Another possibility: \"çok uygunda\" which could mean \"very suitable\" but again, the structure doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the user meant \"çok uygun aldım\", meaning \"I took it very suitable\". But even then, the sentiment isn't clear. If they're saying they got something that was very suitable, that's positive. However, if there's a negative context, like the product wasn't suitable but they had to take it, that could be negative. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"uygundan\" is part of a phrase like \"çok uygundan aldım\", meaning \"I bought it very suitable from...\", which still doesn't clarify the sentiment. The user might have made a typo, but given the information, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nSince \"çok\" is positive, and if \"uygunda\" refers to something being suitable, then maybe the sentiment is positive. However, without clear context, it's safer to go with neutral because the actual sentiment isn't clearly expressed.

Then there's \"di\", which is a bit tricky. It could be part of a verb, like \"dedi\" (said), but here it might be an abbreviation or slang. However, in this context, maybe it's part of \"güzeldi\" which would mean \"was beautiful\". But the user wrote \"güzel di\", so maybe they meant \"güzeldi\" but missed a letter. Alternatively, \"di\" could be a typo for \"dedi\".\n\nNext is \"beğendim\", which means \"I liked it\". That's definitely positive. So putting it all together: if the sentence is \"Güzel dedi beğendim\", that would mean \"He/She said it was beautiful and I liked it.\" But since it's written as \"güzel di beğendim\", maybe they meant \"güzeldi\" (it was beautiful) and then \"beğendim\" (I liked it). Even if there's a typo, the overall sentiment is positive because both \"güzel\" and \"beğendim\" are positive words. The user might have made a typo but the intended message is positive. So the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The user is talking about a product (probably F/P, which might be an abbreviation for something like \"Fiyat/Performans\" or another term). They mention it's very successful in terms of F/P, and when used under specified conditions, it performs its function well. Then they say \"Memnunum :)\", which translates to \"I'm satisfied :)\".\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"çok başarılı\" (very successful), \"gayet yerine getiriyor\" (performs its function very well), and \"Memnunum\" (satisfied). These are all positive indicators. The smiley face :) also reinforces a positive sentiment.\n\nNo negative words are present here. The user is expressing satisfaction and praise for the product's performance under certain conditions. Even though there's a mention of specific conditions (\"Belirttiği şartlar altında\"), the overall tone is positive because the product meets expectations when used correctly.\n\nSo, the label should be POSITIVE.

The word \"güzel\" means \"beautiful\" or \"good.\" So the sentence is saying that the moisturizing aspect is good. \n\nIn Turkish, when someone says something is \"güzel,\" it's usually a positive remark. There's no negative words here. The context seems to be about a product's moisturizing property being praised. \n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but the sentence is straightforward.

The user wrote, \"Poları beğendim sadece, diğerleri biraz kalitesizdi.\" So first, I need to analyze the sentiment here.\n\nThe sentence starts with \"Poları beğendim,\" which translates to \"I liked the Polar (maybe a product or brand).\" That's positive. But then it says \"sadece\" which means \"only\" or \"just,\" so maybe they're limiting their praise. Then the second part: \"diğerleri biraz kalitesizdi.\" That's \"the others were a bit low quality.\" So there's a negative aspect here about other items.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The user liked one thing (Polar) but found others to be of lower quality. However, the main focus might be on the positive part, but since they also mention the negatives, it's a mix. But according to the rules, I have to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nIn such cases where there are both positive and negative elements, sometimes it's neutral. But if one part is more emphasized. Here, the user starts with a positive statement but then points out negatives about other items. However, since they specifically mention liking \"Polar\" and the rest being low quality, maybe the overall sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative. It might be neutral because there are both positive and negative aspects without one overpowering the other.\n\nWait, but sometimes in Turkish, the structure can indicate more emphasis. The first part is a positive statement, but the second part introduces criticism. However, since they only liked \"Polar\" and others were bad, maybe it's leaning towards negative? Or neutral because there are mixed feelings?\n\nHmm. Let me think again. If someone says they liked one product but others were bad, depending on context. But in this case, the user might be referring to different products or aspects of a service. Since the main subject is \"Polar\" and the rest are other items, maybe the overall sentiment isn't strongly positive or negative. It's more neutral because there's both praise and criticism without a clear dominant emotion.\n\nSo I think the correct label here would be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user mentions they wanted this for a long time and it's now on their waist (\"kursağımda kaldı\"), which might be a metaphor for carrying it around, but the outcome is negative.

But the user counters that by saying it's ideal for those with smaller faces. So they're addressing a potential negative point but turning it into a neutral or even positive statement depending on the user's face size.\n\nOverall, the sentiment seems to lean positive because the user is highlighting the good qualities and downplaying the size issue as a matter of personal preference rather than a flaw.

Then, \"küçük boyu çanta için ideal\" means \"the small size is ideal for a bag.\" The word \"ideal\" is definitely a positive adjective here. They're saying the small size fits perfectly for a bag, which is a good thing.\n\nAlso, there's an emoji 👍, which is a thumbs-up. That's a clear indicator of approval or satisfaction. So combining all these elements: using it lovingly, calling the size ideal, and a positive emoji. All of these point towards a positive sentiment. I don't see any negative words or phrases here.

The text is: \"İlk kullandığımda biraz alerji yaptı kullanım bittikten sonra iyice yıkamak lazım bence.

Then they mention that after use, it's important to wash thoroughly. However, they then say \"Ancak harika\" which translates to \"But it's amazing,\" and go on to praise its effectiveness in removing even the smallest details and tiny hairs.\n\nSo there are both negative and positive aspects here.

However, the user is giving a balanced review, pointing out a drawback but also highlighting significant benefits.\n\nIn terms of sentiment analysis, the key is to determine the dominant emotion. Even though there's a negative part, the use of \"harika\" (amazing) and the detailed positive comments about effectiveness might tip the scale towards positive. However, some might argue it's neutral because it's a mixed review. But according to the rules given, if there's a clear positive sentiment despite some negatives, it should be labeled as POSITIVE.

Translating that to English, it means something like \"I just bought it, we'll see after using it regularly and there's a lot inside.\" \n\nFirst, the person mentions they just purchased the product. That's neutral because buying something doesn't inherently indicate positive or negative sentiment.\n\nNext, they say \"we'll see after using it regularly.\" This part is a bit uncertain. They're not giving an immediate opinion but rather indicating that their judgment will come after some time. That leans towards neutral since there's no clear positive or negative feeling here.\n\nThen, the last part: \"there's a lot inside.\" The phrase \"bol bol var\" could be interpreted in different ways. If it's about quantity, like there are many items, that might be positive. But without context, it's hard to tell if they mean it's good (positive) or maybe overwhelming (negative). However, since the user is talking about what's inside, and considering common usage, \"bol bol\" usually conveys abundance, which is generally a positive aspect.\n\nPutting it all together: The first part is neutral, the second part is uncertain but leaning towards neutral, and the last part has a slightly positive nuance. However, since there's no strong positive or negative words, and the overall sentiment isn't clearly expressed, the safest label here would be \"NEUTRAL\".\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Fena değil\" translates to \"Not bad\" or \"Not too bad.\" That's a positive phrase. Then \"fiyatına göre normal\" means \"normal considering the price.\" So they're saying that given the price, it's normal. \n\nHmm, but is that positive or neutral? Well, \"fena değil\" is positive, but \"normal\" might be more neutral. However, in context, when someone says something is normal for the price, they might be implying it's acceptable or even good value. But sometimes \"normal\" can just mean average without strong sentiment.\n\nWait, the example given earlier had \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which was labeled as NEUTRAL. So if the user says \"fiyatına göre normal,\" that's similar to \"okey\" in the example. Both are neutral. But \"fena değil\" is positive. However, the overall sentiment might depend on the combination.\n\nBut maybe the key here is that the user is saying it's not bad and normal for the price. So they're satisfied but not overly enthusiastic. The main point is that the product meets expectations, which is a neutral stance. Because even though \"fena değil\" is positive, the overall context of being \"normal\" in price might balance it out to neutral.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expressing a mild positive sentiment because they're saying it's not bad and acceptable. But according to the previous example where similar phrasing was neutral, I should follow that pattern. So the label here would be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Then there's \"gacur gucur\", which sounds like onomatopoeia, maybe imitating a sound. The ellipsis at the end might indicate trailing off or uncertainty.\n\nThe user is talking about a product (probably an appliance) making noise when used. The words \"gacur gucur\" could be mimicking a loud or unpleasant sound. In Turkish, such onomatopoeia often convey negative connotations if they're describing something unwanted. The use of ellipsis might suggest the user is frustrated or unsure about the situation.\n\nSo, the sentiment here seems negative because the user is pointing out an issue with the product making noise, which is likely a complaint.

The text is: \"Ürünü daha önceden biliyorum aynı kıvamda değil gibinbiraz daha jöle kıvamında\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the user is saying. They mention they already knew the product and note that it's not the same consistency, more like a jelly texture. The key words here are \"aynı kıvamda değil\" (not the same consistency) and \"jöle kıvamında\" (jelly-like texture). \n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The user is comparing the product's texture to something else, pointing out a difference. They might be expressing dissatisfaction because it's different from what they expected or previously known. However, there's no explicit positive or negative language. They're just stating an observation.\n\nBut wait, in Turkish, when someone says \"aynı kıvamda değil\" (not the same consistency), that could imply disappointment if they were expecting a certain texture. However, without more context like complaints about quality or preference for a different texture, it's hard to tell if this is negative. Alternatively, they might be neutral, just describing the product's characteristics.\n\nLooking at the example given in the instructions: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (Okay for the price) was labeled as NEUTRAL. So even if there's a comparison, if there's no clear positive or negative emotion, it's neutral. \n\nIn this case, the user is making an observation about the product's texture but not explicitly stating whether they like or dislike it. They're just noting a difference. Therefore, the sentiment might be NEUTRAL because there's no strong positive or negative feeling expressed, just a factual statement.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The mention of \"another\" might indicate they're not happy about getting a different product than expected.\n\nNext, they didn't return it because they wanted to try it, but then they say it's not as effective as the one in the picture. That part is negative because they're comparing it unfavorably to another product. The key here is that despite trying it out of loyalty, their experience was less positive than expected.\n\nSo, the sentiment isn't purely positive or negative. They have a mix of reasons: loyalty (positive), receiving a different product (neutral?), but then dissatisfaction with effectiveness (negative). However, the overall tone seems more negative because the main point is that the product didn't meet their expectations in terms of effectiveness.

The user starts with positive comments about the product's appearance and naturalness. However, they point out a specific drawback—quick drying. Since the review includes both positive and negative points, but the main focus seems to be on the positive aspects with a minor complaint, it might lean towards neutral. But wait, the instruction says if there's a mix, how do we decide?\n\nLooking at the example given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" translates to \"It's okay for the price,\" which is neutral. Similarly, here the user has both positive and negative points. However, the positive aspects are more about the product's quality, while the negative is a functional issue. But since the user mentions it's better than others in terms of naturalness and beauty, which are strong positives, but also a drawback. \n\nHmm, maybe the overall sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative. The presence of both could make it neutral. However, sometimes if the positive aspects outweigh the negatives, it might be positive. But in this case, the user is pointing out a specific problem, so perhaps it's more neutral because they're not entirely satisfied but have some positives. Alternatively, since they started with positives and ended with a negative, maybe it's mixed but leaning towards neutral. \n\nI think the correct label here would be \"NEUTRAL\" because the review includes both positive and negative elements without a clear overall sentiment.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

There are some typos or maybe non-standard characters like \"iďi\" which might be a typo for \"ili\" or something else. The sentence structure seems a bit fragmented.\n\nBreaking it down: \"tarağı bayağı işpirto tezgahlarında satılan 1 milyoncu iďi plastik çok basit .makasları idare eder\". The user is talking about a product, possibly a plastic item sold at a market (işpirto tezgahı). They mention it's the \"1 milyoncu\" which might mean a millionth or something related to quantity. Then they say \"çok basit\" which translates to \"very simple\" or \"very basic\". The last part is \".makasları idare eder\" which could be \"handles scissors\" or \"manages scissors\".\n\nNow, the sentiment analysis. The key words here are \"bayağı\" which can mean \"very\" but in some contexts might have a negative connotation. However, in this case, it's used with \"işpirto tezgahlarında satılan\" (sold at market stalls), which is neutral. Then \"çok basit\" could be positive or negative depending on context. If the product is supposed to be complex and they say it's simple, that might be negative. But if it's a feature, maybe positive. However, the last part about handling scissors might indicate that the product is not durable or effective, which would be negative.\n\nBut there are typos and unclear parts, like \"iďi\" and \"milyoncu\". Maybe the user meant \"1 milyoncu\" as a model number? Also, the sentence structure is confusing. The overall sentiment seems to be pointing out that the product is simple and maybe not high quality, which could lean towards negative. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.

The task is to label it as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The user mentions \"Kumaş kalitesi güzel\" which translates to \"The fabric quality is good.\" That's a positive point. However, they then say \"ama dikişler ve kesim çok kötü\" meaning \"but the stitching and cutting are very bad.\" That's negative. They also mention issues with the fit: \"bir bacağı kısa bir bacı uzun geldi\" which means \"one leg is short and the other is long,\" indicating a poor fit. Additionally, they note that after washing, the stitches can come undone: \"yıkamadan sonra dikişleri açılabiliyor.\" \n\nSo there are both positive and negative aspects here. The fabric quality is good, but the stitching, cutting, fit, and durability after washing are all negative points. Since the negatives seem to outweigh the single positive point, especially considering the functional issues (fit and durability), the overall sentiment is likely NEGATIVE. However, I need to check if there's a balance that might make it NEUTRAL.

So the sentiment here is likely negative. \n\nI should check if there's any context that might make this neutral, but the phrase itself directly mentions a negative outcome.

So the sentence is saying \"Not 35x50, smaller\". The user is pointing out that the size is not 35x50 but smaller. \n\nNow, considering the context. If someone expected a product to be 35x50 but it's actually smaller, this could be a negative comment because it's not meeting expectations. However, maybe the user is just stating a fact without expressing dissatisfaction. But usually, when people mention that something is different from what they expected, especially in reviews, it's often negative. \n\nBut wait, maybe the user isn't complaining. They might just be informing about the size. However, in most cases, such feedback would indicate disappointment. So leaning towards negative. Alternatively, if there's no emotional charge, it could be neutral. But the use of \"değil\" (not) might imply a negative sentiment. \n\nHmm, but the instruction says to consider the sentiment based on the text.

Finally, \"tavsiye ederim\" is \"I recommend.\" \n\nPutting it all together: The person is saying something is very successful and they definitely recommend it. Both parts are positive. There's no negative language here. Even though \"tavsiye ederim\" could be neutral on its own, in this context, it's used to endorse the product or service.

The original text doesn't mention what it's being compared to. However, the phrase \"daha iyi\" itself is positive because it's indicating an improvement or superiority over another option.\n\nNow, considering the rules for sentiment analysis. If the sentence clearly expresses a positive sentiment without ambiguity, then it should be labeled as POSITIVE. Even though there's no explicit comparison mentioned, the use of \"better\" implies a positive judgment. The user might be comparing it to a previous version or a competitor, but since that's not specified, the key point is the presence of a positive adjective.\n\nI need to make sure there are no negative words here.

Next, they say it showed their skin in a bad way (\"cildimi pul pul gosterdi\"), which sounds like a negative effect. The use of \":(\" adds to the negative emotion. Finally, they mention it didn't come out as a gift (\"hediyede cikmadi\"), which could be disappointing.\n\nAll these points indicate dissatisfaction. There's no positive language here.

The user starts with \"Kesinlikle beğenmedim,\" which translates to \"I definitely didn't like it.\" That's a strong negative statement right there. Then they mention issues with the product: the rope parts are too high up, and the middle part is lower, making it look oval when worn. These are specific complaints about the product's design or fit.\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"beğenmedim\" (didn't like), \"fazla yukarıda\" (too high), \"daha asagıda\" (lower), \"oval gibi giyinince\" (looks oval when worn). All these points are negative aspects. The user is clearly dissatisfied with the product's structure and how it looks when worn.\n\nThe instructions say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there's a clear expression of dissatisfaction and specific complaints, the sentiment here is definitely negative. There's no positive language or neutral statements that might suggest indifference. The user is actively pointing out flaws, so NEGATIVE is the correct label.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user wrote, \"Yorumlar üzerine aldım umarım güzeldir.\" Translating that to English, it means something like, \"I took comments about them, I hope they are nice.\" Hmm, the key parts here are \"umarım güzeldir,\" which translates to \"I hope they are nice.\" The person is expressing a hope that something (probably the comments) are good. \n\nNow, considering the sentiment labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The user isn't directly stating a positive or negative feeling. They're expressing a wish or hope, which is more neutral. There's no strong emotion here, just a mild positive expectation. But since the main action is hoping for something good, maybe it leans slightly positive? Wait, but in sentiment analysis, hopes and wishes can be tricky. If someone says \"I hope it's good,\" that's not necessarily a strong positive statement. It might be more neutral because they're uncertain.\n\nLooking at the examples provided: For instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" translates to \"Okay for the price,\" which is considered NEUTRAL. Similarly, here, the user is expressing a hope but without strong sentiment. The phrase doesn't have clear positive or negative words, just a neutral statement of hoping for something good.

But then there's \"kivirdigini soylemeyecegim\". The word \"kivirmak\" means to twist or contort, and \"soylemeyecegim\" is \"I will not say\". So putting that together, the person is saying they won't mention the twisting part. \n\nHmm, maybe there's some sarcasm here? Like, they're saying it's very good, but then refusing to talk about the negative aspect (the twisting). That could be a mix of positive and neutral, but the main sentiment seems positive because they start with \"çok güzel\". However, the second part might indicate some hesitation or reservation.

Words like \"aşırı kaşındırıyor\" (excessive itching) and \"hiç iyi değil\" (not good at all) are strong negative indicators. The user is complaining about a physical discomfort caused by the product, which is a clear negative experience. Also, mentioning they didn't use it suggests dissatisfaction.

Then \"yapış yapış bir his bıraktı\" translates to \"left a sticky feeling,\" which is also negative because sticky can be unpleasant. The mention of \"temiz ciltte\" (clean skin) might be neutral, but combined with the sticky feeling, it emphasizes the negative experience.\n\nI need to check if there's any positive or neutral elements.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this user review analysis. The text is in Turkish, so I need to make sure I understand the nuances correctly.\n\nFirst, the user starts by saying \"Fiyatına göre ideal bir ürün,\" which translates to \"An ideal product for its price.\" That sounds positive, right? So that's a good sign towards a POSITIVE label.\n\nBut then they mention, \"Çok fazla bir beklentiniz varsa karşılamayabilir.\" Which means \"If you have high expectations, it might not meet them.\" Hmm, this part is a bit negative. It suggests that the product might not live up to very high expectations, so that's a NEGATIVE point.\n\nNext, they talk about the packaging: \"Paketleme iyi değildi ürün kutusu biraz ezilmişti.\" Translating to \"The packaging wasn't good; the product box was a bit crushed.\" That's definitely a negative aspect. So another NEGATIVE point here.\n\nHowever, they end with \"fakat yanında gönderilen minik deneme boy yağ hediyesi için teşekkürler.\" Which means \"But thank you for the small sample size oil gift sent along with it.\" This is a positive note, showing appreciation for the extra item. So that's a POSITIVE point.\n\nNow, I need to weigh these points. The user starts with a positive statement about the price, then mentions some negatives about expectations and packaging, but ends with gratitude for the gift. \n\nThe challenge here is determining whether the overall sentiment leans more towards positive or negative. The initial praise about the product being ideal for its price is strong. However, the criticisms about packaging and unmet high expectations could tip it to negative. But the thank you for the gift adds a positive element again.\n\nIn such cases, I think the key is to see if the negatives are significant enough to outweigh the positives. The user acknowledges the product's value for money but points out some flaws. However, since they still thanked for the gift, maybe it's a mix. But according to the rules, we have to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nLooking at similar examples provided earlier: when there are mixed sentiments, like \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which was labeled NEUTRAL. So if there's a balance of positive and negative points without a clear majority, it might be neutral. However, in this case, the initial statement is very positive (\"ideal bir ürün\"), but followed by some negatives. But the user still ends on a positive note with gratitude.\n\nWait, but maybe the main sentiment here is more neutral because there are both positives and negatives. The product is good for the price, but has packaging issues and might not meet high expectations. However, the gift adds a positive aspect. It's a bit of a toss-up. But in the example given, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was NEUTRAL. So if there are both positives and negatives without clear dominance, it's neutral.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the overall sentiment is still leaning towards positive because the main point about the product being ideal for its price is strong, but the negatives are specific issues that don't necessarily negate the overall value. However, the presence of multiple negative points (expectations not met, packaging) might make it more negative. But the user also thanked for the gift.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. In some cases, if there's a mix, NEUTRAL is appropriate. The user has both positive and negative aspects mentioned. So perhaps the correct label here is NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The text is: \"İyiki almışım dediğim ürünlerin arasına gelir gelmez katıldı ilk kullanışta yüzünüzdeki değişimi %100 görüceksiniz\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context and the emotions expressed here. The user mentions \"İyiki almışım\" which translates to \"I'm glad I bought it.\" That's a positive statement right there. Then they talk about the product joining the list of products they've bought, and upon first use, you'll see a 100% change on your face.\n\nThe key phrases here are \"İyiki almışım\" which is clearly positive. The mention of \"değişimi %100 görüceksiniz\" (you'll see a 100% change) could be interpreted in different ways. If the product is causing a significant change, like a skincare product that makes your skin look better, that's positive. However, if it's something negative, like a bad reaction, that would be negative. But given the context of \"iyiki almışım\" and the structure of the sentence, it seems to be highlighting the effectiveness of the product in a positive light.\n\nI should check for any sarcasm or hidden meanings, but Turkish doesn't use sarcasm as much as English.

Then \"kalitesiz\" translates to \"poor quality\" or \"low quality\", which is definitely a negative term. Next, \"kalıbı\" is \"mold\" or \"pattern\", but in context here, maybe referring to something else like a product's design? Not sure, but the next words are more telling. \"Çok kötü\" is \"very bad\". \"Vasat\" can mean \"average\" or \"mediocre\". \n\nPutting it all together: The user is saying something is very low quality, very bad, and mediocre. All these adjectives are negative. Even though \"vasat\" might be neutral on its own, in this context, combined with \"çok kötü\" and \"kalitesiz\", it's reinforcing the negative sentiment. There's no positive language here. So the overall sentiment is clearly negative. The user is expressing dissatisfaction. \n\nI should make sure there's no sarcasm or hidden meaning, but the words used are straightforwardly negative. No mixed sentiments here.

Then they mention the product isn't like the photo, indicating disappointment in the appearance or quality compared to expectations. The phrase \"çok sıradan\" translates to \"very ordinary\" or \"very plain,\" which is another negative descriptor.

The user is complimenting the packaging and suggesting that it's a good product to buy.\n\nI should check if there's any negative connotation, but I don't see any. Words like \"iyiydi\" and \"alınabilir\" are clearly positive. There's no sarcasm or hidden meaning here. The overall sentiment is positive because the user is recommending the product based on its packaging.\n\nSo the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

I used to use it enthusiastically before.\" \n\nFirst part: \"Kokusu nedense çok kötü\" – they're complaining about the smell being bad. That's a negative sentiment. The word \"çok kötü\" is strong, indicating a negative feeling.\n\nSecond part: \"Daha önce severek kullanıyordum\" – this shows a past positive experience. They used to like it, but now they don't. However, the current sentiment is still negative because the main complaint is about the current bad smell. The past positive experience doesn't override the present negative feeling here.\n\nSo overall, the dominant emotion here is negative.

The user wrote, \"Çok süper diyemem diğerlerinden farkı yok.\" Translating that to English, it would be something like, \"I can't say it's very super, there's no difference from the others.\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment here. The key words are \"çok süper diyemem\" which translates to \"can't say it's very super.\" The word \"süper\" is positive, but the structure \"diyemem\" (can't say) might indicate a negative connotation. Then there's \"diğerlerinden farkı yok,\" meaning \"no difference from the others,\" which suggests that the product or service being discussed isn't any better than others, leading to a neutral or negative sentiment.\n\nLooking at the example given in the instructions: if someone says \"Fiyatına göre okey,\" which is \"Okay considering the price,\" it's labeled as NEUTRAL. Similarly, here the user is expressing that there's no significant difference, so they're not overly positive or negative. They might be indifferent.\n\nBut wait, \"süper\" is a strong positive word. However, the context here is that the user can't say it's very super, which implies disappointment. So maybe it's more negative? But then again, the second part about no difference could be neutral. \n\nHmm, but in Turkish, when someone says they can't call something \"süper,\" it might indicate that their expectations weren't met, leading to a negative sentiment. However, if there's no difference from others, maybe they're just being neutral. It's a bit tricky.\n\nLooking back at the examples: \"Yemek harikaydı\" (The food was amazing) is positive. \"Zehirlendim\" (I got poisoned) is negative. The third example is neutral because it's about price. \n\nIn this case, the user isn't expressing strong dissatisfaction but rather a lack of differentiation. So maybe NEUTRAL is more appropriate here. They're not happy, but they're also not extremely upset. It's a mild negative or just neutral.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

First, I'll read through the text carefully.\n\nThe user says, \"Rengi beklediğimden koyu geldi dudak tonlarında zannediyordum mor gibi ama kokusu ve sürümü çok güzel.\" Translating that: The color was darker than expected; I thought it was a lip tone, maybe purple-like, but the scent and texture are very nice.\n\nNow, breaking down the sentiment. The first part mentions disappointment about the color being too dark and a misunderstanding about the product type (lip tone vs. something else). That's negative. However, the latter part praises the scent and texture as \"çok güzel\" which is positive. \n\nBut wait, the user is mixing both negative and positive aspects. However, in sentiment analysis, if there are both positive and negative elements, but the overall tone isn't clearly leaning one way, it might be neutral. But I need to check the balance. The initial part is a complaint, but the latter part is a strong positive. However, the user might be expressing that despite the color issue, the other aspects are good. \n\nBut according to standard sentiment analysis rules, if there's a mix of positive and negative without a clear dominance, it could be neutral. But sometimes, the presence of both can still lead to a mixed label. Wait, but the options here are only POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The user didn't specify if mixed is allowed. \n\nLooking at the examples given: For instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" translates to \"Okay for the price,\" which is neutral. So in this case, even though there's a negative and positive part, maybe it's considered neutral because the overall sentiment isn't strongly positive or negative. However, sometimes if the positive aspects outweigh the negatives, it might be positive. But here, the user starts with a complaint but ends on a positive note. \n\nBut I need to see which part is stronger. The color being wrong and the product type misunderstanding are specific issues, but the scent and texture are praised as \"çok güzel,\" which is strong. However, in some cases, if there's a mix of both, it might be neutral. But maybe the user is satisfied overall despite the initial problem. \n\nAlternatively, since the user mentions both negative and positive points without a clear conclusion, it could be neutral.

The user starts by saying \"Çok küçük geldi\" which translates to \"It came out very small.\" That's a negative point because they're disappointed with the size. Then they mention \"ml bakmadım alırken\" meaning they didn't check the ml when buying, so maybe they didn't notice the size before purchasing.\n\nNext part: \"ama bu fiyata bu kadar küçük beklemiyodum\" which is \"but I wasn't expecting it to be this small at this price.\" This shows frustration because they feel the product's size doesn't match the price paid. That's another negative sentiment.\n\nHowever, the last part says \"paketleme iyiydi\" meaning \"the packaging was good.\" That's a positive note about the packaging quality.\n\nNow, I need to weigh these points. The main complaints are about the product size not meeting expectations and the price not justifying it. The positive comment is about the packaging, but that's a minor aspect compared to the dissatisfaction with the product itself. \n\nSo overall, the dominant sentiment here is negative because the user is expressing disappointment with the product's value for money, even though there's a small positive remark about the packaging.

The user wrote, \"Çok tatlı bir parıltı veriyor ancak kalıcı olduğu söylenemez.\" Translating that to English: \"It gives a very sweet glow, but it can't be said to be lasting.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The first part, \"Çok tatlı bir parıltı veriyor\" is positive because \"çok tatlı\" means \"very sweet,\" which is a positive adjective. However, the second part uses \"ancak\" which means \"but,\" indicating a contrast. The phrase \"kalıcı olduğu söylenemez\" translates to \"can't be said to be lasting,\" which is negative because it's pointing out a drawback or lack of durability.\n\nSo there's a mix of positive and negative elements. But in sentiment analysis, when there's a contrast like this, the overall sentiment might lean towards neutral if both sides are equally weighted. However, sometimes the presence of a negative aspect can tip the scale to negative, especially if the context is about a product's quality. \n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that \"kalıcı olduğu söylenemez\" is a negative point. However, the first part is positive. The key here is whether the negative part outweighs the positive. Since the user is pointing out both a positive and a negative aspect without strong emphasis on either, it might be considered neutral. But I need to check if there's any stronger sentiment words. \"Çok tatlı\" is quite positive, but \"kalıcı olmadığı\" is a negative. However, in some cases, even with a contrast, the overall sentiment could still be positive if the positive aspect is more emphasized. \n\nBut looking at the structure: the first part is a compliment, but the second part introduces a criticism. In many cases, such mixed sentiments are labeled as neutral because there's no clear dominance of one over the other. However, sometimes the presence of both can lead to a negative sentiment if the criticism is seen as a significant drawback. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's positive because the user starts with a strong positive statement but then adds a minor negative. But in this case, \"kalıcı olduğu söylenemez\" might be considered a more substantial issue depending on the context. Since the user didn't use any extremely negative words, just stating that it's not lasting. \n\nHmm, I think the safest bet here is to label it as NEUTRAL because both positive and negative aspects are present without one clearly overpowering the other.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The first part is \"Saçlarıma parlaklık verdi.\" which translates to \"It gave my hair shine.\" The word \"parlaklık\" means shine or luster, and the verb \"verdi\" is past tense of \"to give.\" So this is a positive statement about the product's effect on the hair.\n\nNext sentence: \"Çok beğenerek kullanıyorum.\" which means \"I use it very much liking it.\" The word \"beğenerek\" is \"liking\" and \"çok\" means very.

Translating it to English might help. The first part, \"ellerimi yumuşacık yapıyor\" translates to \"it makes my hands soft.\" That sounds positive because soft hands are usually a good effect.\n\nThe second part is \"ve gerçekten kuafordan yeni çıkmışımcasına manikür pedikür etkisi veriyor.\" Which means \"and it really gives the effect of having just come out of a beauty salon with manicure and pedicure.\" The words \"gerçekten\" (really) and \"etkisi veriyor\" (gives the effect) suggest that the user is impressed by the results, comparing it to a professional spa treatment. \n\nLooking for positive keywords: \"yumuşacık\" (soft), \"gerçekten\" (really), \"etkisi veriyor\" (gives the effect). These are all positive indicators. There's no negative language here, like complaints or dissatisfaction. The user is expressing satisfaction with the product's effects on their hands and nails, comparing it favorably to a professional service.\n\nSo, the sentiment should be positive.

            "label": "ERROR",
            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wrote a review in Turkish comparing two eye creams: Clinique and All About Eyes. They mentioned that \"Ehh'lik bir ürün daha iyi goz alti kremi var clinique’in bence.\" So they're saying Clinique has a better under-eye cream. Then they suggest, \"Bunu alacaginiza all about eyes’i alin bence,\" which translates to recommending All About Eyes instead.\n\nHmm, the user is giving an opinion that Clinique's product is better but then recommends All About Eyes. Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe they're saying that even though Clinique has a good product, All About Eyes is a better choice? Or perhaps there's confusion in the translation. Let me check the Turkish again.\n\nThe first part says \"Ehh’lik bir ürün daha iyi goz alti kremi var clinique’in bence.\" The word \"Ehh'lik\" might be a typo or slang. Maybe they meant \"Biraz\" (a bit) or another term? But assuming it's correct, the user is saying that Clinique has a better under-eye cream. Then they recommend All About Eyes instead of buying this other product. Wait, maybe the original text refers to a different product than Clinique? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the review.\n\nWait, the user says \"Bunu alacaginiza all about eyes’i alin bence.\" So if someone is considering buying this product (maybe the one they're reviewing), they should buy All About Eyes instead. But earlier they said Clinique has a better under-eye cream. That seems conflicting. Maybe the user is comparing two products and suggesting that even though Clinique's is good, All About Eyes is better? Or maybe there's confusion in the translation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Ehh’lik bir ürün\" refers to another product, not Clinique. But the structure of the sentence is a bit unclear. The key point here is whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The user is giving an opinion that Clinique has a better product but then recommends All About Eyes. That might indicate a mixed sentiment, but since the options are only POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL, I need to determine which applies.\n\nIf the overall recommendation is towards All About Eyes despite mentioning Clinique's product, maybe the sentiment leans more towards positive for All About Eyes and negative for the other product. However, the user hasn't explicitly stated whether they like or dislike either product beyond the comparison. The main action here is a recommendation, which could be neutral if it's just an opinion without strong positive or negative emotions.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the assistant earlier, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL because it's a balanced statement. Similarly, this review is giving a comparison and a recommendation, which might be considered neutral since it's not overly positive or negative but rather an opinion without strong emotional language.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is suggesting that All About Eyes is better than another product (maybe the one they're reviewing), then the sentiment towards All About Eyes could be positive. However, the original text doesn't specify which product is being reviewed here. The user might be comparing two products and recommending one over the other, but without clear context on whether the review is about Clinique or All About Eyes.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me re-express the Turkish sentence again: \"Ehh’lik bir ürün daha iyi goz alti kremi var clinique’in bence. Bunu alacaginiza all about eyes’i alin bence.\" So, the user is saying that Clinique has a better under-eye cream (maybe referring to their own product?), but then advising others to buy All About Eyes instead of this other product. Wait, maybe \"Bunu\" refers to the product being reviewed, which might not be Clinique's. If the review is about a different product and the user is saying that Clinique has a better one, but recommends All About Eyes over the current product, then the sentiment towards the current product would be negative (since they're suggesting another), while the recommendation for All About Eyes is positive. However, since the task is to analyze the given text as a whole, and the user hasn't explicitly stated their satisfaction with either product beyond the comparison, it's more likely that the overall sentiment is neutral because it's an opinion without strong emotional words.\n\nTherefore, labeling this as NEUTRAL makes sense here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

First, I need to understand what the user is saying here.\n\nBreaking it down, \"Yumuşacık ürün\" translates to \"Soft product,\" which sounds positive. Then there's a mention of \"%99 aloa veraysa,\" which might be a typo. Maybe they meant \"aloe vera\"? So, 99% aloe vera? That's a good thing, so that part is positive. Then \"%1 ide sadece parfüm sanırım\" – \"I think only 1% is just perfume.\" The user is pointing out that only 1% is perfume, which might be a negative point if they expected more aloe vera. But the overall sentiment here seems mixed. However, the main focus is on the product being soft and having high aloe vera content, which are positive aspects. The mention of perfume might be a minor negative, but it's not strong enough to make the whole sentiment negative.

Since both aspects are mentioned, but neither is strongly positive or negative. The positive part is mild (\"doesn't bother\"), and the negative part is also moderate (\"not very good\"). \n\nIn such cases where there's a mix of positive and negative but no strong emotions, the label tends to be neutral.

The action here is negative because something breaking (ropes) is typically an undesirable event. There's no positive language or neutral context provided. Even though it's a factual statement, the event itself is negative. However, I should check if there's any ambiguity. If the ropes breaking was expected or part of a process, maybe it could be neutral, but the sentence doesn't indicate that. It just states an occurrence without additional context. Therefore, the sentiment is likely NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The word \"soylenemez\" means \"cannot be said\" or \"inexpressible\". So the whole phrase is something like \"What I really liked cannot be expressed\" or \"It's inexpressible how much I liked it.\"\n\nThe sentiment here seems positive because the person is expressing a strong liking.

First, I need to understand the sentiment here.\n\nThey start by saying they liked the smell (\"beğendim kokusunu\"), which is positive. But then they mention not seeing any other benefits (\"baska ne faydası oldu goremedim\"), which is negative. They also say they'll use it for a while longer to see the effects (\"bı sure daha kullanayım gorcez\"), which seems neutral or cautious.\n\nNow, considering the rules: I have to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The text has both positive and negative elements. However, the overall sentiment might lean more towards negative because the user is expressing disappointment in the product's other benefits despite liking the smell. But there's also a neutral part about continuing to use it. \n\nWait, but according to the guidelines, if there's a mix, how do I decide? The example given for NEUTRAL was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is a balanced view. Here, the user has both positive and negative points but ends with a neutral statement about continuing use. Maybe the overall sentiment isn't strongly positive or negative. However, the initial part is positive, but the main concern is the lack of other benefits. \n\nHmm, maybe it's more negative because the user didn't find any other advantages beyond the smell. But they are still using it, so not entirely negative. Alternatively, since there's a mix, perhaps NEUTRAL is appropriate. Wait, but the examples show that if there's a clear positive or negative sentiment, even with some neutral parts, it might lean towards one. For example, \"Yemek harikaydı.\" is clearly positive. In this case, the user has both positive and negative aspects. However, the main point seems to be dissatisfaction with the product's effectiveness beyond the smell. So maybe NEGATIVE? But they are still using it, so maybe NEUTRAL?\n\nAlternatively, since the user mentions not seeing any other benefits, that might be a stronger negative sentiment. The initial positive part is just one aspect. So overall, the sentiment could be more negative. However, I need to check if the majority of the text leans towards one side. The first part is positive, but the rest is about not finding benefits and uncertainty. Maybe NEUTRAL because they are still using it and haven't decided yet. But the lack of benefits might make it negative. This is a bit tricky.\n\nIn the examples, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. Here, the user is expressing some dissatisfaction but also continuing to use the product. So maybe NEUTRAL is the right label here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user wrote, \"Biraz yoğun ama güzel kapatıyor.\" Translating that to English, it's something like \"A bit intense but closes nicely.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The phrase starts with \"biraz yoğun\" which means \"a bit intense\" or \"a bit busy.\" That part might lean towards negative because \"intense\" can be overwhelming. But then there's \"ama güzel kapatıyor,\" which translates to \"but closes nicely.\" The word \"güzel\" is positive, and \"kapatıyor\" here probably refers to how something ends or concludes.\n\nSo there's a contrast here between the intensity (which could be seen as negative) and the positive closing. In Turkish, using \"ama\" (but) often introduces a contrasting point. The overall sentiment seems mixed, but which part takes precedence? The user might be saying that despite being intense, the experience ends well. \n\nLooking at the examples provided: if there's a mix of positive and negative elements, how is it categorized? For instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral because it's a balanced statement. In this case, the positive part (\"güzel kapatıyor\") might outweigh the slight negative (\"biraz yoğun\"), but maybe not enough to be clearly positive. Alternatively, since there's a clear contrast and both elements are present, it could be neutral.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, even if there's a negative and positive part, the overall sentiment can still be positive or negative depending on context. However, the example given for \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral because it's a balanced view. Here, the user is acknowledging both aspects but ending on a positive note. Maybe that leans more towards positive? Or maybe it's neutral because there are two opposing views.\n\nHmm, I need to decide based on the dominant sentiment. The phrase \"güzel kapatıyor\" is a strong positive statement about how something ends. Even though there's a mention of being intense, the overall impression might be positive. However, if the intensity is a significant negative factor, it could balance out. But in Turkish expressions, sometimes the closing part is emphasized more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"biraz yoğun\" is a minor inconvenience, and the positive closure makes the overall sentiment positive. So the label would be POSITIVE. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: if someone says something was intense but closed nicely, they might be giving a mixed review, which could be neutral. However, in some contexts, ending well can make the whole experience more positive despite the intensity.\n\nLooking back at the examples, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral because it's a balanced statement about price. Here, the user mentions both a negative and a positive aspect, but the positive part might be stronger. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But according to standard sentiment analysis rules, if there's a mix of positive and negative, but no clear dominance, it's neutral. \n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL because it's a balanced view. In this case, the text has both negative (\"biraz yoğun\") and positive (\"güzel kapatıyor\") elements. So maybe it's also neutral. However, sometimes the presence of a positive ending might tip it towards positive. But I think in most cases, when there are opposing sentiments without clear dominance, it's considered neutral.\n\nSo, considering that, the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The emoji is a smiley face, which is positive.\n\nBut wait, the user is expressing a hope here. Hopes can be seen as uncertain, but in sentiment analysis, even hopes might lean slightly positive because they're looking forward to something. However, sometimes uncertainty can be neutral. But since there's an emoji and the overall tone isn't negative, maybe it's more positive.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is just stating a fact that it's their first use and expressing hope without strong positive or negative words, maybe it's neutral. But the smiley face adds a positive nuance. \n\nHmm, but \"umarım\" (I hope) might indicate some uncertainty, which could be neutral. However, in many cases, expressions of hope are considered slightly positive because they're looking forward to a positive outcome. The emoji also reinforces that.\n\nSo I think the label here should be POSITIVE because despite the uncertainty, the overall sentiment is hopeful and the emoji adds a positive emotion.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Then \"pek bir etkisini görmedim hissetmedim\" translates to \"didn't see or feel much effect.\" The user is expressing that despite regular use, there was little to no noticeable effect.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The user is disappointed because they expected some effect from regular use, but didn't experience it. This suggests a negative sentiment. However, I need to check if there's any positive or neutral elements. The sentence structure doesn't have any positive words, just the lack of effect despite usage. So the sentiment here is negative. \n\nBut wait, sometimes people might use neutral language when expressing dissatisfaction. However, in this case, the absence of a positive outcome after regular use typically indicates dissatisfaction, which leans towards negative.

The user might be talking about a product, like perfume or food, but regardless, the sentiment is positive.\n\nI need to make sure there are no hidden negatives or sarcasm. But in Turkish, if someone says \"kokusu güzel,\" it's a direct compliment without any sarcastic undertones unless context suggests otherwise. Since there's no additional context provided, I should stick with the literal meaning.\n\nSo the correct label here is POSITIVE. No need to overcomplicate it.

The overall sentiment seems positive because they're acknowledging the scent as nice despite the initial thought. However, I should check if \"biraz şekerli\" has any negative connotation here. In Turkish, \"şekerli\" can sometimes be used negatively, like something being too sweet or artificial. But in this case, the user follows it with a positive statement about the price, so maybe they're just pointing out a characteristic without strong negativity.\n\nThe key part is \"güzel bir koku\" which is clearly positive.

Even though \"pudralı\" isn't inherently bad, here it's paired with a negative sentiment because the user doesn't like how it looks.

So, \"hoş\" is a clear positive descriptor, and recommending something is a strong positive action.\n\nTherefore, the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Aynı göründüğü gibi\" translates to \"as it appears\" or \"as it seems\". Then \"çok güzel bir ürün\" means \"a very beautiful product\". The structure here is that the user is saying that despite how it looks (maybe they thought it was something else), the product is actually very good. \n\nSo, the key part here is \"çok güzel\", which is clearly positive. Even though there's a contrast with \"aynı göründüğü gibi\", the overall sentiment is positive because the user ends up praising the product. There's no negative language here, just a comparison that leads to a positive conclusion. \n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but in Turkish, sarcasm can be tricky. However, without any obvious sarcastic markers, it's safe to go with the literal meaning.

The text says something about sensitive skin and itching, and after using it, even if your hair turns white, if you wear dark clothes, the fabric becomes very white.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The user is talking about a product, probably a cosmetic or skincare item. They mention that people with sensitive skin should stay away because it causes itching. Then they talk about the effect on hair and clothing. \n\nThe first part is negative: \"hassas cildiniz varsa uzak dürün zira kasinti yapiyor\" translates to advising against using the product for sensitive skin due to itching. That's a clear negative sentiment.\n\nBut then there's a part about the product making hair white and clothing turn white if worn dark clothes. The user might be pointing out a side effect, which could be neutral or even positive depending on context. However, since they mention it in the same sentence as the negative effect, it's probably highlighting an unintended consequence, which adds to the negative sentiment.\n\nThe overall tone seems to warn against using the product due to adverse effects. Even though there's a mention of whitening hair and clothes, that's presented as a problem rather than a benefit. So the dominant sentiment here is negative.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user says, \"The version is easy, actually like the color of Turkish coffee you know, but it could be a more natural coffee. When you add a little bit, it looks more natural.\" \n\nHmm, the person is talking about a product, maybe coffee. They mention that the current version is easy (maybe referring to preparation?), but they think it could be more natural, like traditional Turkish coffee. The part where adding a little makes it look more natural might indicate some dissatisfaction with the current product's naturalness.\n\nBut wait, there's both positive and negative elements. The first part says \"easy\" which is positive. Then they suggest it could be better, which is negative. However, the overall sentiment depends on the balance. Since they're pointing out a possible improvement but not strongly negative, maybe it's neutral? Or does the suggestion of improvement lean towards negative?\n\nIn Turkish reviews, sometimes people mention improvements as constructive feedback, which might be neutral. But if they're criticizing the product's current state, that could be negative. However, the user also mentions that when adding a little, it becomes more natural, which is a positive note. \n\nI think the key here is that the user isn't strongly negative but points out an area for improvement.

First, I need to analyze the sentiment here.\n\nStarting with the words used. \"Abi\" is a casual way of addressing someone, maybe a friend or family member. Then \"almayın\" which means \"don't buy\" – that's a negative suggestion. The next part is \"aldım kullandım aylarca\" meaning \"I bought it and used it for months\". So the person has been using the product for a long time. \n\nThen comes \"hiç ile yaramaz güvenin\". \"Hiç\" means \"never\", \"ile\" is \"with\", \"yaramaz\" could be \"useless\" or \"not helpful\", and \"güvenin\" is \"trust\" or \"rely on\". Putting that together, it seems like the user is saying that using it never helped them, so they can't trust it. \n\nSo the sentiment here is negative.

Translating that to English, it's something like \"not bad, considering the price it can be bought\". \n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment here. The phrase \"fena değil\" is a bit tricky. In Turkish, \"fena\" means bad or poor, so \"fena değil\" literally translates to \"not bad\", which is a positive statement. However, it's often used in a more neutral way, indicating that something is just okay, not great but not terrible.\n\nThen there's \"fiyatına göre alınabilir\", which means \"can be bought considering the price\". This part suggests that the product or service is acceptable given its cost. It's more about value for money rather than outright praise.\n\nPutting it together, the user isn't expressing strong positive feelings. They're acknowledging that it's not bad and that it's worth buying based on the price. But there's no enthusiasm or strong approval here. The sentiment seems to be neutral because they're pointing out a reasonable value without being overly positive or negative. \n\nI should check if there are any hidden negatives. \"Fena değil\" can sometimes imply that there are better options, but in this context, it's more about the price justifying the purchase.

They also recommend it to people who want to buy the product.\n\nI should check if there's any negative language, but I don't see any.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence: \"Yıllardır\" means \"for years\" or \"for a long time\", indicating a prolonged period. Then \"sadece 16\" translates to \"only 16\". The ellipsis at the end might suggest trailing off, maybe uncertainty or hesitation.\n\nThe phrase \"sadece 16\" could be pointing out that something has remained at 16 for years, which might not be a positive thing. Depending on context, if it's about age, maybe someone is saying they've been stuck at 16 for years, which would be negative. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the use of \"sadece\" (only) might imply that 16 is a low number, so perhaps dissatisfaction. \n\nBut since there's no clear positive or negative words here, and the sentiment isn't explicitly stated, maybe it's neutral.

The phrase \"asla bıkmadan\" is very positive because it indicates that the user has never gotten tired of using this perfume, which suggests a high level of satisfaction. \n\nThe word \"tek\" (only) emphasizes that this is the sole perfume they use, implying that others might not meet their standards.

The first part is \"Kokusu çok güzel.\" which translates to \"The smell is very nice.\" The word \"güzel\" means beautiful or nice, so that's a positive adjective. Then there's a period, and the second part is \"Ciceksi bir kokusu var.\" which means \"It has a floral scent.\" \"Ciceksi\" refers to something related to flowers, like floral. \n\nNow, both parts are talking about the smell in a positive way. The user is expressing satisfaction with the fragrance, mentioning it's nice and floral. There's no negative language here. Even though there's a period separating the two clauses, they're both contributing to a positive sentiment. \n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but Turkish doesn't use sarcasm as much as English, and the words used are straightforward. \"Çok güzel\" is a clear positive statement.

First, I need to understand the content.\n\nThe text starts with \"kargo hızlı ve özenliydi\" which translates to \"the shipping was fast and careful.\" That's positive. Then there's \"ama üründen ekstra bir beklentiye gerek yok\" meaning \"but there's no need for extra expectations from the product.\" That's neutral, maybe a bit negative but not strongly.\n\nNext part: \"abartılmış tenim çok açık olmasına rağmen yüzüme çok açık kaldı ve beyaz bir tabaka gibi durdu.\" Translating to \"even though my skin is very oily, it stayed very visible on my face and looked like a white layer.\" This seems negative because the product didn't perform well despite the user's expectations.\n\nSo there are mixed sentiments here. The shipping was good (positive), but the product didn't meet expectations (negative). However, the overall tone might lean more towards negative because the main subject is the product's performance, which is a key factor in reviews. Even though there's a positive part about shipping, the negative aspects of the product itself are more impactful. But I need to check if the user considers both parts or focuses on the product. Since the review mentions the product's issues after the initial positive note, it might be neutral overall because the user is pointing out that expectations shouldn't be too high, but the experience was still negative. Wait, but \"ama\" (but) introduces a contrast. The main sentiment here is negative towards the product despite the positive shipping. However, the instruction says to label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there's both positive and negative elements, but the overall sentiment might be neutral because the user is balancing between the good service and the product's shortcomings. But maybe the dominant part is negative. Alternatively, since the user mentions that expectations shouldn't be too high, which could imply a neutral stance. Hmm. It's tricky. The key is whether the overall sentiment is more negative or neutral. The product didn't meet expectations, leading to dissatisfaction, so maybe NEGATIVE. However, the presence of both positive and negative elements might make it NEUTRAL. But in reviews, if the main issue is with the product itself, even if shipping was good, the overall sentiment would be negative.

I need to determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentences. The first part says \"İlk yıkamada baskısı soldu.\" Translating that, \"baskı\" here probably refers to the pressure or firmness of the fabric. \"SOLDU\" means it decreased. So maybe after the first wash, the fabric became less stiff. That could be a negative point if the user expected it to stay firm, but maybe neutral if it's just a change.\n\nNext sentence: \"Tam beden oluyor.\" \"Tam beden\" means it fits perfectly. That sounds positive because fitting well is usually a good thing.\n\nThird part: \"Salaş bir model.\" \"Salaş\" can mean cheap or low-quality. So that's negative. But maybe in some contexts, it could be neutral if they're just describing the model as simple. However, combined with the previous points, the user might be expressing dissatisfaction with the quality.\n\nPutting it all together: The first part is neutral or slightly negative, the second is positive, and the third is negative. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning towards negative because of the criticism about the model being cheap, even though there's a positive note about the fit. However, if \"salaş\" is used in a neutral way here, maybe it's just describing the style without judgment. But usually, \"salaş\" has a negative connotation. So I think the overall sentiment is negative.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

It comes from \"uygun,\" which can mean appropriate, suitable, or reasonable. So putting it all together: \"The price was appropriate according to the market.\"\n\nNow, considering the context. When someone says the price is appropriate relative to the market, they're likely expressing satisfaction. If the price is in line with what's expected in the market, that's a positive thing for the buyer. They might feel they got a fair deal. However, I should check if there's any ambiguity. The word \"uygundu\" here is positive because it indicates that the price meets expectations. There's no negative connotation here. It's not neutral either because it's making a judgment about the price being suitable. So the sentiment is positive.\n\nWait, but sometimes people might use \"uygun\" in a more neutral way. But in this context, since it's comparing to the market, which is a common benchmark, saying it's appropriate would be a positive assessment. The user is probably happy with the price.

The example given for similar cases, like \"Zehirlendim,\" which means \"I got poisoned,\" was labeled NEGATIVE.

The user wrote, \"Kokusu güzel fiyatı güzel ama kokusu kalıcı değil.\" Translating that to English: \"The smell is nice, the price is good but the smell isn't lasting.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The user starts by saying both the scent and the price are good, which are positive points. However, they then mention that the scent isn't lasting, which is a negative aspect. \n\nNow, the challenge is determining whether the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The key here is the structure of the sentence. The user acknowledges two positives but follows with a negative. In such cases, the presence of both positive and negative elements can lead to a neutral sentiment if they balance each other out.\n\nBut wait, in some contexts, even if there's a negative point, if the overall experience is still considered good, it might lean positive. However, the user specifically points out a drawback that affects the product's effectiveness (the scent not lasting). This could be seen as a significant negative aspect, especially if the primary function of the product is its fragrance.\n\nHowever, since the user mentions both positives and negatives without strongly emphasizing one over the other, it might be neutral. But I need to check if the negative part is more impactful. The fact that the scent isn't lasting could be a deal-breaker for some, but others might still appreciate the price and initial smell. \n\nIn sentiment analysis, when there are mixed sentiments, especially with both positive and negative aspects without clear dominance, neutral is often the safest label. However, sometimes the presence of a negative can tip it to negative if the context implies dissatisfaction despite positives. But in this case, the user isn't overly negative; they're just pointing out a flaw. \n\nConsidering the example given where \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled neutral, which translates to \"Okay for the price,\" implying that while there are positives and negatives, it's acceptable. Similarly, here, even though there's a negative, the user isn't entirely dissatisfied. Therefore, labeling this as neutral makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's size and comfort. However, they also mention not wanting to go through the trouble of returning it, which might indicate some inconvenience but not necessarily a strong negative feeling towards the product itself.\n\nThe keywords here are \"küçücük\" (too small), \"sık dokusu var\" (tight fabric), and \"iade ile uğraşmak istemediğim için gondermeyecegim\" (don't want to deal with returns). The first two points are clearly negative aspects of the product. However, the user's decision not to return it might be due to laziness or inconvenience rather than satisfaction with the product. \n\nBut in terms of sentiment analysis, the primary focus is on the negative experience with the product's fit and texture. Even though they're not returning it, their dissatisfaction is evident. The mention of hoping it doesn't irritate them adds a bit of uncertainty but still leans towards a negative sentiment.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

But then they say that using it before bed dries out the acne in the morning, which is a positive effect. The last part mentions \"Hızlı kargolandı\" (shipped quickly), which is neutral or slightly positive.\n\nSo there's a mix of negative and positive aspects.

Then there's \"alıyor işe yarıyor\". The word \"alıyor\" means \"taking\" or \"getting\", and \"işe yarıyor\" means \"useful for work\" or \"gets the job done\". So putting that together, it seems like the person is saying that whatever they're talking about (maybe a product or service) is very good and effective for work.\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"güzel\" is positive, \"işe yarıyor\" is also positive because it's about being useful. There's no negative language here. The user might be reviewing something like a tool or software that works well. \n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but in Turkish, the direct translation doesn't suggest that.

There's no explicit positive or negative adjective here. Words like \"harika\" (great) would be positive, \"zehirlendim\" (poisoned) is negative.

The phrase \"fiyatına göre\" translates to \"considering the price,\" which might imply that the smell is good for the price, maybe not the best but acceptable.\n\nBut wait, in Turkish, when someone says something like \"fiyatına göre güzel,\" they're often expressing that despite possible shortcomings, the product is good for its price. So it's a positive sentiment because the user is satisfied with the value for money. There's no negative words here. Even though \"fiyatına göre\" might suggest some limitations, the overall sentiment is still positive due to \"güzel.\"\n\nI should check if there are any sarcasm or hidden meanings, but in this case, it seems straightforward.

These all indicate a negative experience with the product, suggesting it's causing discomfort or not working as expected.\n\nSo the sentiment here is clearly negative.

The user mentions \"en sevdiğim kuru şampuanım\" meaning \"my favorite dry shampoo,\" indicating satisfaction with the product.

The user starts with positive words: \"Güzel\" (beautiful) and \"kalıcı\" (long-lasting), which are definitely positive. Then there's a contrast with \"ama\" (but), indicating a negative point. They mention it's \"biraz ağır\" (a bit heavy) for daytime, which is a negative aspect. However, they follow up by saying it's more suitable for night (\"gece için daha uygun\"), which is a positive note again.\n\nSo the review has both positive and negative elements. The challenge is to determine the overall sentiment. The user acknowledges the product's qualities but points out a drawback. However, the final part suggests that despite the heaviness during the day, it works well at night. This might lean towards neutral because the reviewer is pointing out both pros and cons without strongly favoring one over the other. But I need to check if the positive aspects outweigh the negative or vice versa.\n\nIn Turkish reviews, sometimes even with negatives, if there's a recommendation or a positive conclusion, it can be seen as neutral.

Since \"iyi\" is a positive adjective, the overall sentiment here should be positive. There's no negative language or any neutral terms that might suggest indifference. The user is clearly expressing satisfaction with the price performance.\n\nI need to make sure there are no hidden nuances. Sometimes in Turkish, context can change the meaning, but in this case, it's straightforward. The label should be \"POSITIVE\" as per the guidelines given.

The whole phrase might be describing something that doesn't give up on closing, maybe in a context like a door or an opportunity. However, without more context, it's tricky. \n\nBut looking at the words individually, \"vazgeçilmeyen\" is negative, and \"kapatıcı\" could be neutral or slightly negative depending on context.

The sentence structure suggests a negative connotation because the speaker is pointing out an undesirable quality—something being oily, which might be a complaint about food texture or product consistency.

Translating that to English, it means something like \"We used it for 1-2 days, we'll see more, there's still no light.\" \n\nHmm, the first part mentions using a product for a short period. The phrase \"bakacağız\" translates to \"we'll see,\" which might indicate uncertainty or hesitation. Then they say \"daha bir ışık yok,\" meaning \"there's still no light.\" The word \"ışık\" can be literal (light) or metaphorical, like hope or clarity.\n\nLooking at the sentiment, the user is expressing that after using the product for a couple of days, there's still no improvement or positive outcome.

Gerçek ten indirim li olsaydı👎\". \n\nFirst, they start with positive feedback about the moisturizing effect and recommend it, which is a positive point. Then there's a contrast with \"ama\" (but), indicating a negative aspect. They mention that pharmacies have this price, implying it's expensive or not discounted. The use of 👎 suggests dissatisfaction with the lack of discount.\n\nSo, the sentiment isn't purely positive or negative. There's both praise and criticism. However, the overall tone might lean more towards neutral because the user is pointing out a drawback despite liking the product. But wait, the example given in the rules had \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" as neutral. Here, the user is complaining about the price not being discounted, which could be negative. But they also recommend it. Hmm.\n\nWait, the examples: when there's both positive and negative elements, how to classify? The rule says if it's mixed, maybe neutral. Let me check the example again. In the third example, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. Here, the user is saying the product is good but the price isn't discounted. So it's a mix of positive and negative. But according to the rules, if there's both, maybe it's neutral? Or does the presence of criticism make it negative?\n\nBut in the example given by the user, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is considered neutral. Here, the user is not just saying it's okay but actually has a positive comment and a negative one. However, since they are giving a recommendation despite the price issue, maybe it's more neutral. Alternatively, if the negative part is stronger, it could be negative. But the initial positive statement might balance it out.\n\nI think in this case, the user is expressing both satisfaction with the product and dissatisfaction with the pricing. Since there's no clear dominance of one sentiment over the other, the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

However, in some contexts, people might use it sarcastically or with negative connotations if they're upset about their skin. But without more context, like if there's an emoji or additional text showing frustration, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe user's example for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which translates to \"Okay for the price,\" indicating a neutral stance. Similarly, \"Sivilce yaptı\" is a straightforward statement of fact. There's no clear positive or negative sentiment here. Unless there's an implied negative emotion, but the sentence itself is just stating that someone got a pimple. So I think it's neutral.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

First, I need to read through the entire comment carefully.\n\nThe user starts by saying they gave 5 stars because they have hope (\"ümidim var\"). Then they mention that previous reviews helped them prepare for possible side effects (\"yanmaya\"). They talk about their experience: after two minutes, they started feeling a burning sensation. Without the reviews, they might have been scared. They then describe taking action by wearing compression tights and going on a 12,000-step walk. After 40 minutes, the burning subsided. They mention that continuing the treatment while lying down isn't effective and that support is needed. They also suggest using a body roller with retinol and C vitamin for better results. Finally, they end by saying this is their personal experience to help others.\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment. The user mentions positive aspects like giving 5 stars, hope, and helpful reviews. However, there are negative parts too: burning sensation, fear of side effects, and some caution about not continuing the treatment while lying down. But overall, they're sharing their experience to help others, which is a positive intent. They also mention effective methods (compression tights, body roller) which could be seen as neutral or positive. The mixed feelings here are there, but the overall tone seems more on the positive side because they ended up managing the effects and provided helpful advice. However, some parts might lean negative due to the discomfort experienced. But since the user is sharing their experience to help others and ends with a positive note about possible solutions, I think the sentiment is neutral. Wait, but the initial 5-star rating is positive. Hmm. Maybe it's positive because they gave a high rating despite the issues. Alternatively, the negative aspects might make it more neutral. But in Turkish reviews, giving 5 stars even with some negatives can still be considered positive.

The word \"efsane\" here is positive because it's used to describe something in a very favorable way. The adverb \"gerçekten\" emphasizes the positivity. There's no negative language here. Even though \"efsane\" can sometimes have a neutral connotation depending on context, in this case, paired with \"gerçekten,\" it's clearly a strong positive statement.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but Turkish doesn't use sarcasm as frequently as English, and the sentence seems straightforward. The user might be talking about a product's scent, like a perfume or food, and they're expressing satisfaction. \n\nSo the label should be POSITIVE.

The second part, \"daha iyileri vardır,\" means \"there are better ones,\" which suggests that the current option isn't the best. \n\nLooking at the possible labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The user is advising against purchasing something, implying dissatisfaction. However, they aren't explicitly stating a negative experience but rather suggesting there's a better alternative. \n\nBut wait, in sentiment analysis, even if it's not a direct complaint, the overall tone here is cautioning against a purchase, which leans towards negative. The user might be indicating that the product isn't worth it, hence the negative sentiment.\n\nAlternatively, could it be neutral? Neutral would be if there's no strong positive or negative feeling.

The text is: \"Güzel fakat bedeninizden 1 beden büyük alın yurtmacı çok fazla ve kemeri çok kötü\". \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence. The user starts with \"Güzel\" which means \"Good\" or \"Nice,\" so that's a positive word. But then there's \"fakat\" which translates to \"but,\" indicating a contrast. After that, they mention \"bedeninizden 1 beden büyük alın\" – this seems like advice about sizing, suggesting to take one size larger. Then \"yurtmacı çok fazla\" – \"yurtmacı\" might refer to something related to the brand or origin, and \"çok fazla\" means \"too much,\" which is negative. Finally, \"kemeri çok kötü\" – \"kemeri\" is belt, and \"çok kötü\" is \"very bad,\" another negative point.\n\nSo even though there's an initial positive word, the rest of the sentence points out several issues with the product (size, brand, belt quality). The negatives seem to outweigh the single positive term. In Turkish sentiment analysis, when there's a contrast like \"fakat\" followed by multiple negative aspects, the overall sentiment is usually negative. \n\nI should check if there are any other nuances. Maybe \"yurtmacı\" refers to something specific that could be neutral, but combined with \"çok fazla\" it becomes negative. The belt being \"çok kötü\" is a strong negative.

Then there's a smiley :D, which is positive, but the overall experience seems mixed.\n\nThe key points here are the initial negative experience (\"işe yaramadı\", \"izi çıktı\"), followed by a positive note after showering. However, the user ends with \"ama duştan sonra derseniz birazcık eh işte\" which translates to something like \"but if you say after showering, it's just a bit... well\". This seems like they're acknowledging that it works somewhat after showering but not entirely satisfied.\n\nThe smiley :D might indicate some positive sentiment, but the overall context is more about the product not working as expected initially and having mixed results. The user mentions both negative aspects (didn't work, caused irritation) and a partial positive (worked after shower). However, the conclusion seems to lean towards neutral because they're not entirely happy but also not completely dissatisfied. They might be giving it a try but with reservations.\n\nConsidering the rules, I need to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The presence of both negative and positive elements makes me think NEUTRAL is appropriate here.

Maybe the person is not entirely sure if it's good, just guessing.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL.

They mention that it was made very sensitive (\"çok hassas yapmışlar\"), and they couldn't use it (\"ben kullanamadım\").\n\nNow, looking at the keywords: \"koptu\" means came off or broke, which is negative. \"Çok hassas yapmışlar\" could be a positive point if it's about sensitivity, but in this context, since the item came off easily, it's more likely a negative aspect. The user couldn't use it, which indicates dissatisfaction.\n\nSo the sentiment here seems negative. The person is expressing frustration because the product didn't last and was too sensitive, leading to them not being able to use it.

Translating the key parts: \"alakası yok\" means \"no relation\" or \"not related.\" The user mentions that only the back part is okay (\"sırt kısmi\"), but the rest is fake (\"gerisi yalan\"). They also say there's no relation to the chest and waist (\"boyu göğsü alakası yok\") and they're going to return it (\"iade edicem\").\n\nThe sentiment here seems negative.

This might be neutral or slightly negative if the user expected more variety, but since they don't express dissatisfaction here, it's probably neutral.\n\nThen, \"Fondöten fırçası süper.\" translates to \"The Fondöten brush is super.\" That's clearly positive, highlighting a specific product feature they like.\n\nHowever, there's a negative point: \"Ama allık sürmek için biraz sertler ama yine de iş görüyor.\" Which means \"But they're a bit harsh for applying foundation, but still get the job done.\" Here, the user points out a drawback (being too firm), but also acknowledges that it works. This seems like a mixed sentiment, but since the overall tone isn't overly negative and they mention it's functional, maybe leaning towards neutral or slightly positive.\n\nPutting it all together: The review has both positive aspects (value for money, specific brush being good) and some neutral/negative points (similar brushes, firmness).

The word \"uygun\" here is positive because it's indicating that the price is appropriate, which is a good thing. The adverb \"çok\" intensifies the positivity. There's no negative language here.

The verb \"bırakıyor\" is \"leaves\" or \"leaving\". So the sentence is saying something like \"Leaves gray tones at percent\" or \"Percent leaves gray tones.\" \n\nHmm, that's a bit unclear. Maybe it's referring to a product or process that results in gray tones when applied at a certain percentage? For example, maybe a hair dye or a chemical process where using a certain percentage leads to gray tones. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The words themselves don't have inherently positive or negative connotations. \"Gray tones\" could be neutral in some contexts, but if it's about something like hair color, leaving gray might be seen negatively if someone is trying to avoid graying. However, without knowing the context (like whether it's a desired effect or not), it's tricky.\n\nSince there's no clear positive or negative words here, and the sentence seems more descriptive than expressing an opinion, the most appropriate label would be NEUTRAL.

The user is clearly expressing a strong negative feeling here. They're stating that they did not like something, and the use of \"hiç\" emphasizes the intensity of their dislike.

The options are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since the text is clearly negative, the label should be \"NEGATIVE.\" \n\nI should also check if there's any possibility of it being neutral.

The user provided a Turkish text, and I need to determine the sentiment label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The user starts by saying \"Fiyatına göre güzel bir ürün\" which translates to \"For its price, it's a good product.\" That sounds positive. But then they mention \"fakat pudrayla sabitlenmediği sürece çizgilerde birikiyor,\" meaning \"but if not fixed with powder, it accumulates in the lines.\" That's a negative point about the product's performance.\n\nNext, they talk about \"Kapatıcılığı orta derecede\" which is \"The coverage is medium level.\" Medium might be neutral, but depending on context. Then, \"Yoğun kıvamlı bir kapatıcı olduğundan dolayı da biraz zor dağılıyor,\" translating to \"Because it's a dense consistency concealer, it's a bit hard to spread.\" This seems like another negative aspect regarding application difficulty.\n\nSo there are both positive and negative elements. The initial praise about the price is positive, but the subsequent points about not staying in place without powder and being hard to apply are negatives. However, the user doesn't express strong dissatisfaction; they're pointing out specific issues rather than outright condemnation. \n\nConsidering the balance, the review has mixed sentiments but leans more towards negative due to the functional drawbacks mentioned. However, since there's a positive note about price, maybe it's neutral? But the negatives are about product performance, which is crucial. The user might be giving a neutral rating because they acknowledge both pros and cons without strong emotional language. Wait, but in Turkish reviews, sometimes even with some negatives, if the overall experience isn't strongly negative, it could be neutral. Alternatively, if the negatives affect usability, it might be negative.\n\nHmm. Let me check the example given. For instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled NEUTRAL. Here, the user says \"güzel bir ürün\" (good product) but then lists some drawbacks. The presence of both positive and negative aspects without a clear dominant sentiment might make it neutral. However, in some cases, if the negatives are about functionality, it could be negative.

First, I need to understand the content thoroughly.\n\nThe text starts with \"Sürüldüğünde cildi yumuşacık pürüzsüz yapıyor\" which is positive, mentioning soft and smooth skin. Then it says \"ama etkisi bir süre sonra geçiyor\" – the effect doesn't last long, which is a negative point. Next, \"kış günlerinde kuru ciltkilerin ihtiyacını karşılayacağını düşünmüyorum\" indicates that the user thinks it's not suitable for dry skin in winter, another negative. However, there's a positive note: \"makyaj altına güzel oluyor\" meaning it looks good under makeup. Finally, \"görseldeki ürün değil ph koruyucu ürün geliyor\" suggests that the product is a pH protector instead of what was shown in the image, which might be neutral or slightly negative if there's a discrepancy between expectations and reality.\n\nNow, weighing the positives and negatives. The positive aspects are about texture and makeup application. Negatives include short-lasting effects and not being suitable for dry skin in winter. The mention of pH protector might be neutral but could hint at unmet expectations. However, since the user is pointing out both pros and cons without strong negative emotions, maybe it's more neutral overall. But the negatives are significant enough to tip it towards negative? Or does the presence of both positive and negative elements make it neutral?\n\nIn Turkish sentiment analysis, sometimes mixed reviews can be neutral if there's a balance. However, the user is expressing dissatisfaction with effectiveness (short-lived effect, not suitable for dry skin) which might lean more towards negative despite some positives. But I need to check if the negatives are stronger. The positive parts are about immediate effects, while the negatives are about long-term or specific conditions. It's a bit tricky. Maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because there are both positive and negative points without a clear dominance.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Or maybe it's slightly negative because the main point was the absence of the gift. Wait, but the user also says \"Bioderma farkı kendini belli ediyor\" which is a positive statement about the product's effectiveness.

That sounds negative because it's pointing out a flaw.\n\nBut then they add, \"Ama asıl görevi bu değil zaten.\" Which means \"But that's not its main purpose anyway.\" This suggests they understand that the product isn't meant to be opaque, so maybe the lack of coverage isn't a big issue. Then they mention they haven't tested if it protects from the sun yet. \n\nSo there's a mix here. The first part is negative about the color and coverage, but the second part is more neutral or even slightly positive because they acknowledge the product's intended use. However, since the main point of sunglasses is to protect from the sun, not having that feature tested might be a concern.

The user is pointing out a flaw but also explaining it's not the main purpose. So maybe neutral? But there's a slight negative note about the color and coverage. However, since the user is making excuses for it (not its main purpose), it might lean more towards neutral. I need to check if the overall sentiment is more negative or neutral.

The key words are \"ama\" (but) and \"bence\" (I think). The first part says the product is regular size, which might be neutral or positive, but the second part expresses a personal opinion that it's actually small. This seems like a negative comment because they're pointing out a discrepancy between the stated size and their experience.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's not strongly negative. They might just be stating an opinion without strong emotions. However, in sentiment analysis, even if it's a mild disagreement, it could lean towards negative. Alternatively, if there's no clear positive or negative words, it might be neutral. But the use of \"ama\" suggests they're correcting or contradicting the initial statement, which often indicates dissatisfaction.\n\nHmm, but the user didn't mention any problems with the product beyond size. So maybe it's more about a personal preference rather than a negative experience. However, in many contexts, pointing out that something is smaller than expected could be seen as a negative point, especially if it affects their satisfaction.\n\nI think the best label here is \"NEGATIVE\" because they're expressing that the product doesn't meet their expectations regarding size, which is a common issue that would lead to dissatisfaction.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The text is: \"Kokusu çok güzel ve kalıcılığı gayet iyi ancak sıcaklarda pek de işe yaramadı maalesef.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The first part says the scent is very nice and the longevity is good. Those are positive points. Then there's \"ancak\" which means \"but,\" indicating a contrast. The next part mentions that in hot weather, it doesn't work well, and \"maalesef\" means \"unfortunately.\" That's negative.\n\nSo the review has both positive and negative aspects. But how to classify the overall sentiment? The user might be expressing mixed feelings. However, the instructions say to use only POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there are both positive and negative elements, but no clear dominance, maybe it's neutral? Wait, but sometimes if there's a clear contrast with a negative part, even if there are positives, the overall could be negative. But in this case, the user is pointing out both good and bad aspects. However, the presence of \"maalesef\" adds weight to the negative part. Hmm.\n\nWait, the example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which translates to \"Okay considering the price,\" implying a neutral stance. In this case, the user is giving both positive and negative feedback. But does that make it neutral? Or is the overall sentiment more negative because of the disappointment expressed with \"maalesef\"? Alternatively, maybe the positives are strong enough to make it positive. But I think in such cases where there's a clear negative point despite some positives, it might lean towards negative. However, different people might interpret it differently. Since the user is using both positive and negative aspects, but not clearly more of one than the other, perhaps NEUTRAL is appropriate here. Wait, but the example for neutral was a single statement without contrast. Maybe in this case, since there's a clear negative part after the positives, the overall sentiment is NEGATIVE? Or maybe it's mixed, but the system requires choosing between the three labels.\n\nAlternatively, if the negatives are more impactful, like the product not working well in hot weather, which might be a significant drawback, then the overall could be negative. But I'm not sure. The instruction says to analyze and choose one label. Maybe the presence of both positive and negative elements makes it neutral? Or maybe the negative part is stronger because of the \"maalesef.\" Hmm.\n\nI think in this case, since there's a clear negative aspect mentioned with an expression of regret, even though there are positives, the overall sentiment might be NEGATIVE. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, if the user is just stating both sides without a clear preference, it could be NEUTRAL. However, the use of \"maalesef\" suggests that the negative part is more impactful. So maybe NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Translating that to English, it's \"the product is nice but the size is small\". \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The first part is positive: \"ürün güzel\" means the product is good or nice. That's a clear positive statement.\n\nThen there's the conjunction \"ama\", which means \"but\". This usually introduces a contrast or a negative point. The second part is \"kalıp küçük\", meaning the size is small. Depending on context, this could be negative if the user expected a larger size, but sometimes people might find it neutral if they didn't mind the size.\n\nHowever, in sentiment analysis, even if there's a positive and a negative part, we have to see which one dominates. Here, the user starts with a positive comment about the product itself but then points out a negative aspect regarding the size. Since both parts are present, it might be neutral because the overall experience isn't clearly positive or negative. But sometimes, if the positive is more significant, it could still be positive.

Alternatively, if the negative part is a complaint that affects the overall satisfaction, it might be negative.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the text: \"boyutu küçük biraz zaman alıyor\". I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, translating the Turkish text to understand better. \"Boyutu küçük\" means \"the size is small.\" Then \"biraz zaman alıyor\" translates to \"takes a little time.\" So the whole sentence is saying that because the size is small, it takes a bit of time. \n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The user might be talking about something like a product or service where the size being small is causing a delay. The mention of \"zaman alıyor\" (taking time) could imply inconvenience, which might lean towards negative. However, sometimes people might find the small size acceptable even if it takes longer. But in this case, since there's no explicit positive language, and the focus is on the time taken due to a negative aspect (small size), it's more likely negative. \n\nWait, but maybe \"biraz zaman alıyor\" isn't necessarily negative. If someone is patient or doesn't mind waiting a little, it could be neutral. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's an implication of inconvenience without any positive counterbalance, it's usually considered negative. The user didn't express satisfaction with the time taken, just stating a fact. So maybe neutral? Hmm.\n\nBut looking at the example given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as neutral. That's about being okay with the price. Similarly, if the text is just stating a fact without clear positive or negative sentiment, it's neutral. However, in this case, \"boyutu küçük\" might be seen as a drawback, and \"zaman alıyor\" adds to that. But since there's no explicit emotion, maybe it's still neutral.\n\nWait, but the user is pointing out a problem (small size causing delay), which could be negative. However, without any clear positive or negative words, it's tricky. The examples given by the user might help. For instance, \"Yemek harikaydı.\" is clearly positive. \"Zehirlendim.\" is negative. The third example is neutral because it's a balanced statement.\n\nIn this case, the text is stating two facts: small size and taking time. There's no clear positive or negative sentiment expressed. So maybe it's neutral. But I'm not entirely sure.

However, the second part is \"güzell kokuyor,\" which means \"it smells nice.\" That's a positive statement about the scent.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The user is expressing two contrasting points: confusion (negative) and a pleasant smell (positive). But in Turkish, when someone says they didn't understand much but then mentions something positive, it might be more neutral because the negative part isn't strongly expressed. The use of \"gibi\" (like) in \"pek birsey anlamadim gibi\" suggests that the confusion is not absolute, maybe just a perception.\n\nAlso, considering the structure, the sentence starts with a negative but ends with a positive.

Yağlı ciltler için uygun bence.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The person is talking about their skin. They mention that it's a bit dry and mat, but then say it's suitable for oily skin.\n\nBreaking it down: \"Cildimi biraz kuruttu\" – this part sounds negative because they're saying their skin is dry. Then \"Mat duruyor\" – which could be neutral or slightly positive if they like the matte finish. But the last part, \"Yağlı ciltler için uygun bence\" – here they're stating that it's suitable for oily skin, which might be a positive point.\n\nBut wait, the first two parts are about their own experience. The dryness and matness could be seen as negative effects. However, the last part is a recommendation based on their opinion. But since the overall sentiment seems to mix both negative (dryness) and neutral/positive (suitable for oily skin), but the main issue here is that they're pointing out a negative effect on their own skin. Even though they mention it's suitable for oily skin, the personal experience of dryness might dominate the sentiment.\n\nIn Turkish, \"bence\" means \"I think,\" so the last part is their opinion. But the first two statements are factual about their skin's condition. So the overall sentiment leans more towards negative because the user is expressing a problem (dryness) even though they provide a positive note for others with oily skin. However, since the analysis is based on the user's own experience, the negative aspects might be more prominent here.\n\nSo I think the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The text is: \"Çok güzel nemlendiriyor, kuru ciltlere birebir.. piyasaya göre de indirimli fiyat 🏷\". \n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The first part says \"Çok güzel nemlendiriyor\" which translates to \"It moisturizes very well.\" The word \"çok güzel\" is clearly positive. Then \"kuru ciltlere birebir\" means \"perfect for dry skin,\" which is also a positive statement.\n\nNext, the user mentions \"piyasaya göre de indirimli fiyat\" which is \"discounted price compared to the market.\" That's another positive point because a good deal is usually seen as favorable. The emoji 🏷 might be a sticker or a tag, but it doesn't add negative sentiment here.\n\nI need to check if there's any hidden sarcasm or negative connotation, but in Turkish, the phrases used are straightforward. Words like \"çok güzel,\" \"birebir,\" and \"indirimli\" are all positive indicators. There's no mention of any drawbacks or complaints. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the sentiment is definitely positive.

The text is: \"Basmalı olarak görünüyor ancak normal kapaklı geldi ve hiçbir faydası olmadı çok fazla kepek yaptı ve daha fazla dökülüyor\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user mentions that something was expected to be \"basmalı\" (which I think refers to a type of packaging or closure, maybe a screw cap?), but it arrived as \"normal kapaklı\" (normal capped). Then they say it had no benefit, caused a lot of dust (\"kepek\"), and is leaking more.\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"hiçbir faydası olmadı\" translates to \"had no benefit\" which is negative. \"Çok fazla kepek yaptı\" means it produced a lot of dust, which is also negative. \"Daha fazla dökülüyor\" indicates more leakage, another negative point. The initial expectation vs reality (\"basmalı olarak görünüyor ancak normal kapaklı geldi\") shows disappointment.\n\nSo the sentiment here is clearly negative. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's performance and quality. There's no positive language here, just complaints.

But then there's a contrast with \"terlemeyi engellemiyor ama ter kokusu olmuyor.\" Let me break that down.\n\n\"Terlemeyi engellemiyor\" means \"it doesn't prevent sweating,\" which might be neutral or slightly negative, but the next part is \"ama ter kokusu olmuyor,\" meaning \"but there's no odor of sweat.\" The user is pointing out a positive aspect here—no smell. So even though it doesn't stop sweating, the absence of odor is a good thing.\n\nPutting it all together: The main sentiment is positive because the user starts with being very satisfied and ends on a positive note about the product's effectiveness in preventing odor. The mention of not preventing sweat might be a minor point, but since they don't express dissatisfaction with that part, the overall sentiment remains positive.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

However, they mention that except for that, the packaging was good and arrived quickly.\n\nNow, breaking down the sentiment. The negative part is about the brushes being short and some parts being loose. But the user chose not to return them, which might indicate a slight inconvenience but not a strong negative. Then there's a positive note about the packaging being good and delivery fast. \n\nThe overall sentiment seems mixed, but since the user didn't return the product despite the issues, maybe it's leaning more towards neutral. However, the presence of both negative aspects (short brushes, loose parts) and positive (good packaging, quick delivery) might balance out. But in Turkish, sometimes the structure can be tricky. The phrase \"ama onun haricinde\" means \"except for that,\" which could imply that despite the issues, other aspects were good. \n\nBut according to the rules, I need to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.

The user wrote, \"Rengi ve dokusu güzel fakat kalıcı değil.\" Translating that to English, it means \"The color and texture are nice but not durable.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The first part, \"renk ve dokusu güzel\" is positive because they're complimenting the appearance. However, the second part, \"fakat kalıcı değil\" introduces a negative aspect about durability.\n\nNow, the challenge is determining whether the overall sentiment is more positive, negative, or neutral. The user mentions both positive and negative points. But in sentiment analysis, if there's a contrast like this, it often leans towards negative because the negative part might be a deal-breaker. However, sometimes if the positive aspects are strong enough, it could be neutral.\n\nBut looking at the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. That's a case where the sentiment is mixed but not strongly negative or positive. Similarly here, the user has both positive and negative points. However, the presence of \"fakat\" (but) indicates that the negative part is a significant drawback. \n\nIn many cases, when there's a contrast like this, especially in product reviews, the overall sentiment tends to be negative because the negative aspect might outweigh the positive one. But I need to check if the user's examples support that. The example given for NEUTRAL was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is more of an indifferent statement. Here, the user is pointing out a specific flaw despite liking some aspects.\n\nSo, considering that, maybe it's negative. However, sometimes in such cases, if both positive and negative are present without one clearly dominating, it might be neutral. But I think in this case, since the product isn't durable, which is a major issue, the sentiment would lean towards negative. \n\nWait, but the user's example for NEUTRAL was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is a balanced view. Here, the user has both positive and negative aspects, so maybe it's neutral. However, in some contexts, if the negative part is more critical (like durability), it might be considered negative. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think again. The key here is whether the negative aspect is a major issue. If someone says the color and texture are nice but not durable, they might be indicating that despite the good looks, the product isn't long-lasting. That's a significant downside. So maybe it's more negative than neutral. But in some cases, people might consider both aspects equally, leading to neutral.\n\nBut looking at the examples provided by the user: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" is positive, \"Zehirlendim.\" is negative, and \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. The third example is a case where there's no strong sentiment, just an okay statement. Here, the user has both positive and negative points, but not in a way that's indifferent. They are pointing out a specific problem. So maybe it's more negative.\n\nAlternatively, if the product isn't durable, but other aspects are good, it might be neutral because there's no clear overall sentiment. But I think in most cases, when someone mentions both pros and cons, especially with a contrast like \"but,\" it's considered negative because the con is highlighted as a drawback. \n\nSo, after considering all that, I think the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The next part is \"resmen saçları dik dik kökten cıkarıyor.\" \"Resmen\" is like \"literally\" or \"seriously,\" and \"saçları dik dik kökten cıkarıyor\" translates to \"pulls the hair out from the roots, straight up.\" This might be a bit of an idiom or slang. \n\nPutting it all together, the person is expressing high satisfaction with something (probably a product or service related to hair removal), recommending others to try it because it's effective. Even though there's some intensity in the description (\"kökten cıkarıyor\" which could be seen as harsh), the overall sentiment is positive due to the strong approval and recommendation.\n\nI should check if any negative words are present, but \"bayağı memnunum\" is clearly positive. The rest reinforces that satisfaction. So the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The first part says they don't think it's original at all (\"Kesinlikle orijinal olduğunu düşünmüyorum\" translates to \"I definitely don't think it's original\"). That sounds negative.\n\nThen they mention \"Kirpiği bırak hiç bişi yapıştırmaz.\" Translating that, maybe something like \"Leaving the quills (of a hedgehog) doesn't stick anything.\" It's a bit unclear, but the context might be about something not working properly or being ineffective. The word \"yapıştırmaz\" means \"doesn't stick,\" which could imply failure or ineffectiveness.\n\nThe last part is \"İMKANSIZ,\" which means \"Impossible.\" That's a strong negative term. So combining all these parts, the user is expressing dissatisfaction with something not being original, not working as intended, and calling it impossible. \n\nLooking at the labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The overall sentiment here is clearly negative. There's no positive language, just complaints and strong negative terms. Even if there was some ambiguity in parts of the text, the use of \"İMKANSIZ\" makes it clear that the sentiment is negative.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

However, I should check if there's any context that might change this. Since there's no additional information, it's just a statement about the price being optimal. The user might be satisfied with the price, so that leans towards positive. But wait, sometimes \"uygun\" can also mean \"suitable\" without necessarily being positive.

But then there's \"vaz geçilmesim\" which is a bit tricky. \"Vaz geçmek\" usually means to avoid something, so \"vaz geçilmesim\" would be \"I should avoid it.\" The emoji 🤭 adds a hint of embarrassment or secrecy, maybe implying that the speaker is trying to hide their opinion.\n\nPutting it all together: Even though the scent has become classic (which might be a positive), the speaker is suggesting they should avoid it. The overall sentiment here seems negative because despite one positive aspect, the recommendation is to avoid it.

Then \"askıları düsüyoe\" might be a typo for \"askılar düştü\" which means \"the straps fell down\". Next, \"omzumdan beğenmedim\" is \"I didn't like it on my shoulders\", and \"iade\" means \"return\".\n\nSo the user is talking about a product (probably clothing) they bought in size S. The straps are falling down from their shoulders, which they don't like, so they want to return it. The sentiment here seems negative because they're expressing dissatisfaction with the product's fit and functionality, leading to a return request.\n\nI should check if there's any positive or neutral elements, but the main points are about not liking the straps falling and wanting to return it.

I need to analyze the sentiment here.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The person is talking about a product, probably a cosmetic or skincare item since they mention \"rengi\" (color) and \"tenime\" (my skin). They start by saying \"beyaz tenli olmama ragmen\" which translates to \"despite not being fair-skinned\" or \"even though I'm not white-skinned.\" Then they say the color stayed on their skin very light, \"çok beyazz\" at the end. \n\nThe key words here are \"çok acık kaldı\" (remained very light) and \"çok beyazz\" (very white). The user is expressing that the product's color didn't suit them, maybe it's too light for their skin tone. Even though they aren't fair-skinned, the product's shade was still too light, which might be a negative experience. They might be disappointed because the product didn't match their expectations.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in Turkish, \"acık\" can have different connotations. However, in this context, since they're talking about color staying on the skin, it's more likely referring to the shade being too light. The repetition of \"çok beyazz\" emphasizes that it was very white, which might not be desired. \n\nSo the sentiment here is negative because the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's performance regarding color matching.

The person is talking about purchasing something, possibly a supplement or product related to muscle development. The phrase \"inşallah iyi gelir\" translates to \"I hope it works well\" or \"I hope it turns out good.\" \n\nNow, looking at the keywords: \"alDIM\" (bought) and \"iYİ gELİR\" (hope it works). The use of \"inşallah\" indicates a hopeful expectation. There's no explicit negative language here. The person is expressing a wish for the product to be effective, which is a positive outlook.\n\nHowever, there's no strong positive sentiment either. They're not overly excited or using superlatives. It's more of a neutral hope. But wait, \"iYİ gELİR\" is a positive outcome they're hoping for. So maybe it's leaning towards positive because they have a favorable expectation.\n\nBut I should check if there's any hidden negative context. The user didn't mention any dissatisfaction or problems. They just expressed hope that the product will work. In sentiment analysis, expressions of hope for a positive outcome are generally considered positive, even if the current state is neutral.\n\nSo considering all that, the label should be POSITIVE because they're expressing a hopeful expectation towards a beneficial result.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Like if someone says something didn't work but isn't necessarily negative about it. However, in most cases, saying something didn't work implies a negative outcome. The user examples don't have a neutral case for this kind of phrase. The example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey,\" which is more of a neutral acceptance based on price.\n\nSo, considering the typical usage, \"işe yaramadı\" is expressing that something failed to work, which is negative. Therefore, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a Turkish text that needs sentiment analysis. The task is to label it as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The user mentions that they bought something based on reviews, but people who smelled it reacted negatively, calling it \"hacı kokusu\" (which translates to something like \"scent of a pilgrim,\" often used derogatorily in Turkish). They also say that despite the good effect, the smell is annoying.\n\nSo there are mixed elements here. The user acknowledges a positive aspect (\"etki olarak güzel\") but points out a negative one (\"koku olarak rahatsız edici\"). However, the overall sentiment seems more negative because the main issue (the smell) is highlighted as bothersome, even though there's a positive note about the effect. But I need to check if the negatives outweigh the positives here.\n\nIn Turkish, when someone mentions both positive and negative aspects but ends with a strong negative statement, it might lean towards NEGATIVE. However, sometimes NEUTRAL is used if there's a balance. But in this case, the user is complaining about the smell despite the good effect, which could be seen as more negative overall.\n\nWait, but maybe the user is trying to say that even though the product has a good effect, the smell is bad. So it's a mixed review. However, according to the rules, if there's a mix, how do we decide? The example given for NEUTRAL was \"Fiyatına göre okey,\" which is neutral because it's a balanced statement. But here, the user is pointing out a significant negative aspect (the smell) that's bothering people, even though there's a positive part. \n\nIn such cases, if the majority of the sentiment is negative, we should label it as NEGATIVE. The fact that they mention others' reactions (\"hacı kokusu diye tepki verdi\") and their own discomfort with the smell suggests a stronger negative sentiment. The positive part is just a counterpoint but doesn't outweigh the main complaint.\n\nSo I think the correct label here is NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user wrote, \"Beklentimi çok fazla karşılamadı ama güzel bir baz.\" Translating that to English: \"It didn't meet my expectations very much but it's a good base.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The first part says it didn't meet expectations, which is negative. But then there's \"ama\" which means \"but,\" introducing a contrast. The second part is positive, saying it's a good base.\n\nNow, the challenge is determining whether the overall sentiment is more negative, positive, or neutral. The user is expressing both dissatisfaction and some level of satisfaction. However, the key here is that the main sentiment might be leaning towards negative because the primary action (not meeting expectations) is emphasized first, followed by a mitigating positive comment. But sometimes, in such cases, if the positive part is significant enough, it could tip the scale.\n\nBut looking at the structure: \"didn't meet my expectations\" is a strong negative statement. The second part is a positive remark but might be seen as a minor point. In many sentiment analysis contexts, when there's a contrast like this, the dominant emotion is considered. However, if both parts are equally weighted, it might be neutral.\n\nWait, but in Turkish, \"ama\" can sometimes indicate that the second part is more important. So maybe the user is saying that despite not meeting expectations, there's still a positive aspect. But does that make the overall sentiment neutral? Or does the initial negative statement overpower it?\n\nAnother angle: The phrase \"güzel bir baz\" (a good base) might imply that while it wasn't perfect, it's still acceptable or has potential. This could be seen as a mixed sentiment, but since we have to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL, and the user didn't express a clear overall positive or negative feeling, maybe NEUTRAL is appropriate here.\n\nBut I need to check examples given. For instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. That's a similar case where there's a mix but no strong sentiment.

The first part is \"Cildine göre değişir tabi\" which translates to \"It depends on the skin type, of course.\" That seems neutral because it's stating a fact that results can vary based on individual skin conditions.\n\nThen there's \"ama anneme aldık soyulma yaptı\". The word \"ama\" means \"but,\" indicating a contrast. \"Anneme aldık\" is \"we bought it for my mom.\" The last part \"soyulma yaptı\" translates to \"it caused peeling\" or \"it made her skin peel.\" That's negative because peeling is an adverse effect, suggesting the product might have been harsh on her skin.\n\nPutting it together: The user acknowledges that results vary by skin type (neutral), but then mentions a negative outcome (peeling) when their mom used it.

The phrase \"fiyatına göre iyi\" (good for its price) is a positive remark, but the second part about not meeting expectations is negative. Since both parts are present and there's no clear indication of which is more important, it might lean towards neutral because the user is pointing out both pros and cons without a strong overall sentiment.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in Turkish, the use of \"fakat\" (but) can indicate that the second part is the main point.

The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's size and its effectiveness in providing a massage.\n\nLooking at the rules, I need to categorize this as either POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since the user is clearly unhappy with the product's performance, it's a negative sentiment.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Aşık olduğum\" translates to \"I am in love with\" which is a strong positive emotion. Then \"bir koku\" means \"a scent\" or \"an aroma,\" so they're talking about being in love with a particular smell. The word \"orjinal\" means original, which can be neutral on its own but here it's paired with the previous part. The emoji 💖 is a heart symbol, often used to express love or affection.\n\nPutting it all together, the person is expressing that they are in love with a scent and calling it original. The use of \"aşık\" (in love) and the heart emoji clearly indicate positive feelings. There's no negative language here. Even \"orjinal\" doesn't have a negative connotation in this context; it might even be positive as it adds to the uniqueness of the scent.\n\nSo, the sentiment is definitely positive. No ambiguity here. The user is happy with the product, probably a fragrance or something related to smell. They're expressing affection and satisfaction.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The user is expressing dissatisfaction because the product doesn't match the photo, which is a common complaint. Words like \"ufak\" (small) and \"boşuna almayın\" (don't buy unnecessarily) indicate negative feelings.

Then they mention \"Çok iyi paketlenmişti, elime çok hızlı ulaştı.\" So the product was well packaged and arrived quickly. Both of these are positive points.\n\nNext part: \"kullandığınız anda saçlarınızın yumuşadığını fark ediyorsunuz kokusuda çok iyi denemelisiniz.\" When using it, you notice your hair becomes softer, and the smell is also very good.

Then they mention that when the larger part spins, it makes noise. However, they conclude by saying it's a good product otherwise.\n\nSo, there are both negative and positive points. The negatives are about the packaging and the noise. The positives are about the product being good otherwise. But the overall sentiment here is mixed. However, in the example given earlier, when there are both positive and negative aspects but the user still ends with a positive note, it's considered \"NEUTRAL\". Wait, no, looking back at the examples: the third example was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which translates to \"Okay for the price,\" leading to NEUTRAL. But in this case, the user has both complaints and praise. However, the key is whether the overall sentiment leans more towards positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nBut according to the rules, if there's a mix but no clear dominance, it might be neutral. However, the user ends with \"bir de Büyük tarafı dönerken ses çıkartıyor\" (also, when the larger part spins, it makes noise) and then says \"Diğer türlü iyi bir ürün.\" (Otherwise, it's a good product). So they acknowledge some issues but still consider it a good product. That might lean more towards positive because despite the negatives, the overall assessment is positive. But maybe not. Alternatively, since there are clear complaints, it could be negative. Wait, but in the example where the user says \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is neutral, but here they have both positives and negatives. However, the conclusion is that it's a good product otherwise. So perhaps the overall sentiment is positive despite the issues mentioned. But I need to check if the negative aspects are significant enough to make it negative. The user mentions two negatives: no box (which affects preservation) and noise when spinning. Then they say \"otherwise\" it's a good product. So maybe the negatives are specific issues but the overall product is still considered good. Therefore, the sentiment might be neutral because there are both positive and negative points without a clear dominance. Alternatively, if the user ends with a positive statement, maybe it's positive. But I need to see the examples again. The first example was \"Yemek harikaydı.\" which is clearly positive. The second was \"Zehirlendim.\" clearly negative. Third was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" neutral. In this case, the user has both complaints and praise but ends with a positive note. However, the presence of multiple negatives might tip it to negative. But the last sentence says \"otherwise, it's a good product,\" which could mean that despite those issues, the product is still good. So maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because there are both positives and negatives. Alternatively, if the user is satisfied enough despite the flaws, it could be positive. Hmm. This is tricky. But according to standard sentiment analysis, when there's a mix but no clear dominance, it's neutral. However, in some cases, if the conclusion is positive, it might lean towards positive. But I need to follow the examples given. In the third example, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral because it's a balanced statement. Here, the user has both negative and positive points but ends with a positive assessment. However, there are specific complaints that might make it negative. Alternatively, since they mention \"otherwise\" it's good, maybe the negatives are considered minor issues. So perhaps the label should be NEUTRAL because there are both positive and negative aspects without a clear overall sentiment.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The person is talking about using a product (probably a humidifier) in the fridge for three days and mentions that after letting it sit in the fridge, the humidifier absorbs better. \n\nNow, looking at the keywords: \"3 gündür uyguluyorum\" means they've been using it for three days. \"Buzdolabında beklettikten sonra\" translates to \"after leaving it in the fridge.\" Then \"gerçektende nemlendirici daha iyi emiliyor\" – here, \"nemlendirici\" is humidifier, and \"daha iyi emiliyor\" means it's absorbing better. \n\nThe user seems satisfied with the product's performance after using it in the fridge. Words like \"gerçektende\" (actually) and \"daha iyi\" (better) indicate a positive outcome. There's no negative language here, just a statement of improvement.

Then they express a hope (\"inşallah işe yarar\" – \"I hope it works\"), which is positive. However, the second part says they're not very hopeful (\"pek umutlu değilim\").

The user starts with hope but ends with lack of hope. The overall tone seems more negative because the final statement is about not being hopeful despite the initial hope. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's neutral because they're uncertain.

Now, I need to determine the sentiment here.\n\nFirst, the phrase \"görmedim\" translates to \"didn't see\" or \"didn't notice\". The context here is about not perceiving an effect. Depending on the situation, this could be neutral. For example, if someone expected an effect but didn't notice it, they might just be stating a fact without positive or negative emotions. However, sometimes not seeing an effect could imply disappointment, which would be negative. But in many cases, especially if there's no explicit emotion expressed, it's safer to go with neutral.\n\nLooking at the examples provided: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL because it's a matter-of-fact statement. Similarly, \"Etkisini görmedim\" is a straightforward statement without clear positive or negative connotations. The user isn't expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction explicitly.

The user is expressing disappointment or frustration about something not functioning as expected.

Words like \"uygun\" are generally positive because they indicate something is appropriate or good value. However, I should check if there's any context that might change the sentiment. But in this case, the phrase is straightforward. It's a common expression used to describe a product or service that's priced fairly. There's no negative language here. The user didn't mention any dissatisfaction or issues with the price.\n\nComparing it to the examples given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. But \"uygun fiyat\" is more positive because \"uygun\" directly implies a positive assessment of the price. So the label should be POSITIVE.

However, \"ancak\" translates to \"but\" or \"however,\" indicating a contrast. Then \"çok küçük\" means \"very small.\" So the sentence is saying something is beautiful but very small.\n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The presence of both positive (\"güzel\") and negative (\"çok küçük\") elements suggests a mixed sentiment. But according to the rules, I have to choose one label. Since there's no clear dominance of one emotion over the other, and the user examples show that neutral is used for balanced or indifferent statements, this might lean towards NEUTRAL. However, sometimes in such cases, if there's a positive aspect followed by a negative, it could be seen as slightly negative. But given the example where \"fiyatına göre okey\" was neutral, which is similar in structure (positive and neutral elements), I think NEUTRAL is appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

First, I need to analyze this in Turkish.\n\nThe sentence seems a bit fragmented. Let me break it down. \"Keske\" is like \"If only\" or \"I wish\", which often indicates regret or a negative feeling. Then \"düzenli.kullanabilseydim\" – maybe they meant \"düzenli kullanabilseydim\" (if I could use regularly). The typo with the period might be a mistake, but it's probably \"kullanabilseydim\". \n\nNext part: \"henüz emin diyilim\". \"Henüz\" means \"not yet\", and \"emin diyilim\" is \"I can't say for sure\" or \"I'm not certain\". So putting it all together: \"If only I could use it regularly, I'm not sure yet.\" \n\nThe sentiment here seems negative. The person is expressing regret about not being able to use something regularly and uncertainty. Words like \"keske\" (if only) and the uncertainty in \"henüz emin diyilim\" point towards a negative emotion. There's no positive language here, just frustration or dissatisfaction. So the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The reason for returning the product is due to poor quality, which indicates a negative experience. Even though there's a factual statement about returning the item, the underlying feeling is clearly negative.\n\nI need to check if there's any neutral aspect, but the use of \"sevmedim\" (didn't like) is a strong indicator of dissatisfaction.

The word \"güzel\" translates to \"beautiful\" or \"good\" in English, which is a positive adjective. The verb \"temizliyor\" means \"is cleaning\" or \"cleans\". So the sentence is saying something like \"cleans beautifully\" or \"cleans well\".\n\nNow, considering the context, when someone says that someone cleans beautifully, it's likely a compliment. The use of \"güzel\" here is definitely positive. There's no negative language or any neutral terms that might indicate indifference. The person is expressing satisfaction with the cleaning done.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but in Turkish, sarcasm can be tricky. However, without any additional context or cues like exaggerated language or obvious contradictions, it's safe to assume the sentiment is positive. The user might be talking about a service provider, like a cleaner, and they're happy with the job done.\n\nComparing to the examples given: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" (The food was amazing) is positive, similar to this case. \"Zehirlendim.\" (I got poisoned) is negative. \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (Okay for the price) is neutral.

The text is: \"ürün efsane cilti gerginlestirdi ama blomein de kullanıyorum etkisi tarif edilmez\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user mentions that the product (probably a skincare product) tightened their skin (\"gerginlestirdi\"), which is a positive effect. However, they also mention using \"blomein\" and say the effect is indescribable (\"etkisi tarif edilmez\"). \n\nNow, breaking it down. The first part is positive because tightening the skin is a good outcome. But then there's an \"ama\" (but), which usually introduces a contrast. They mention using another product, blomein, and the effect is indescribable. That could be neutral or even negative if they're implying that the other product isn't effective. However, the phrase \"etkisi tarif edilmez\" might mean that the effect is so strong it's hard to describe, which could still be positive. \n\nBut wait, the user is comparing two products? Or are they using both? The sentence structure is a bit unclear. They say they use blomein as well (\"blomein de kullanıyorum\"), so maybe they're using both products. If the product in question (efsane cilti) tightened their skin, that's positive. But if they mention another product and the effect is indescribable, it might be neutral because they're not directly criticizing the product but just stating a fact about the other one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"etkisi tarif edilmez\" is meant to convey that the effect is so good it can't be described, which would still be positive. However, without more context, it's tricky. The presence of both positive and neutral elements might lead to a neutral label overall because there's no clear negative sentiment expressed towards the product being reviewed. \n\nBut I need to check if \"blomein\" is a typo or another product name. If it's a competitor product, maybe they're saying that even though they use blomein, the effect of efsane cilti is still amazing. But the sentence structure isn't entirely clear. The main point is that the product tightened their skin (positive), and they also use another product with an indescribable effect. Since there's no explicit negative statement about the product in question, the sentiment might lean positive. However, the presence of \"ama\" could indicate a contrast, but without a clear negative part, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is saying that even though they use blomein, the effect of efsane cilti is so good it can't be described. In that case, both parts are positive. But if \"etkisi tarif edilmez\" is meant to imply that the other product isn't effective, then maybe negative. However, in Turkish, \"tarif edilmez\" usually means something that's too intense or indescribable, not necessarily bad. \n\nConsidering all this, the main positive effect from the product is clear, and the rest might be neutral. So the overall sentiment would be positive.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The user is talking about a product, probably lip balm or something similar, given the mention of \"dudak\" (lips) and \"kurutmuyor\" (doesn't dry out). The words used are positive: \"kremsi dokusu\" (creamy texture), \"aşırı doğal duruyor\" (looks very natural), and \"asla kurutmuyor\" (never dries out).

Maybe \"ucuk dudak rengi gibi\" (like a pink lip color), but that's still a positive attribute since it's describing the color as natural. \n\nSo, all the adjectives and phrases used are positive.

The sentence starts with \"Alev alev yanıyor ama dayanılmayacak gibi değil,\" which translates to something like \"It's burning brightly, but it doesn't seem unbearable.\" The use of \"ama\" (but) here might indicate a contrast between the intensity and the lack of discomfort.\n\nNext part: \"spor yaparken yanmasını hissetmek daha çok mutlu ediyor hatta.\" This means \"feeling it burn while exercising actually makes me happier, even.\" The words \"mutlu ediyor\" (makes happy) are clearly positive. The phrase \"hatta\" adds emphasis, suggesting a strong positive feeling.\n\nThen there's a mention of Seda Altın hocam with heart emojis: \" Ürünle tanışmamı sağlayan Seda Altın hocam❣️❣️\". This is a compliment to the person who introduced the product, which is also positive. The emojis reinforce the positive sentiment.\n\nNow, considering all parts: despite the initial mention of burning (which could be negative), the overall context is about feeling happy and satisfied with the product, especially during exercise. The contrast here is that the burning sensation isn't unpleasant but actually enjoyable. The gratitude towards Seda Altın adds to the positive tone.\n\nI should check if there's any hidden sarcasm or negative undertones, but the text seems genuine. Words like \"mutlu ediyor\" and the emojis are strong indicators of a positive sentiment. Even though there's mention of discomfort (\"yanıyor\"), it's immediately followed by a positive outcome. \n\nSo, the label here should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The first part is \"yorumlara bakarak aldım\" which translates to \"I bought it based on reviews.\" That seems neutral because they're just stating a fact about their purchase decision. \n\nThe second part is \"pek fazla etkisini görmedim.\" Translating that, \"pek fazla\" means \"not very much,\" and \"etkisini görmedim\" is \"I didn't see the effect.\" So putting it together, they're saying they didn't notice a significant effect. \n\nNow, considering the context. If someone buys something based on reviews but doesn't see much effect, that could be negative because their expectations weren't met. However, the user might not be explicitly complaining; they might just be stating a fact without strong emotions. \n\nBut wait, \"pek fazla etkisini görmedim\" implies disappointment. If they expected a certain outcome from the product based on reviews but didn't experience it, that's a negative sentiment. Even though there's no explicit complaint, the lack of effect compared to expectations is a negative point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're neutral because they're just reporting their experience without strong positive or negative emotions. But usually, when someone mentions not seeing an expected effect, especially after relying on reviews, it leans towards negative. \n\nI think in this case, the sentiment is negative because the user's expectation (based on reviews) wasn't met, leading to a negative experience.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Then \"bir güneş koruyucu\" is \"a sunscreen.\" The last part is \"çok memnunum,\" which translates to \"I'm very satisfied.\" \n\nThe key words here are \"memnunum\" (satisfied) and the context of continuous use.

Then there's \"alıyor,\" which means \"is taking\" or \"is getting.\" The phrase \"kurtarıcı\" means \"rescuer\" or \"savior.\" So putting it together, the user is saying something like \"Perfect, taking the rescuer\" with a thumbs-up emoji. \n\nThe context might be someone expressing relief or satisfaction that a rescuer (maybe in an emergency situation) is arriving. The use of \"mükemmel\" and the emoji 👍🏻 both indicate a positive sentiment. There's no negative language here, just strong approval. Even though \"alıyor\" could have different contexts, in this case, it seems to be part of a positive statement. \n\nI don't see any sarcasm or hidden meanings that would make this neutral or negative.

The user wrote: \"Paketleme gayet güzel ancak epey geç geldi eczacı tavsiyesi ile aldım yeni kullanmaya başladım umarım etkili olur :)\". \n\nFirst, I need to break it down into parts. The first part is \"Paketleme gayet güzel\" which translates to \"The packaging is very good.\" That's a positive statement.\n\nThen there's \"ancak epey geç geldi\" meaning \"but it arrived quite late.\" This is negative because the delivery was delayed.\n\nNext, \"eczacı tavsiyesi ile aldım\" means \"I bought it on the recommendation of the pharmacist.\" This is neutral; it's just stating a fact about how they acquired the product.\n\n\"Yeni kullanmaya başladım\" translates to \"I've just started using it.\" Also neutral, indicating the beginning of use.\n\nFinally, \"umarım etkili olur :)\" which is \"I hope it works effectively :).\" The smiley suggests some optimism, but the uncertainty here might lean slightly positive, though it's not a strong sentiment. However, since they're hoping for effectiveness and haven't experienced results yet, it's more of a neutral or cautious note.\n\nNow, considering the overall sentiment: there are both positive and negative elements. The packaging is good (positive), but the delivery was late (negative). The rest is neutral.

So putting it all together, the user is saying there's a problem with dripping and contamination. That sounds negative because they're pointing out issues. \n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or context I'm missing, but the text seems straightforward.

The user wrote, \"Çok kötü üsttede durmuyor.\" Translating that to English, it would be something like \"Very bad, not staying on top.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The word \"çok kötü\" directly translates to \"very bad,\" which is a strong negative expression. That's a clear indicator of a negative sentiment.\n\nThen there's \"üsttede durmuyor,\" which means \"not staying on top.\" Depending on context, this could refer to something not maintaining its position or quality. However, the presence of \"çok kötü\" already sets a negative tone. Even without the second part, the first part is enough to label it as negative.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but in Turkish, direct expressions like \"çok kötü\" are usually straightforward. The sentence doesn't have any positive words or neutral phrases that might shift the sentiment. \n\nSo combining both parts, the overall sentiment is clearly negative. The user is expressing dissatisfaction, probably with a product or service that isn't maintaining its quality or position.

The first part, \"Tonu varla yok arası,\" translates to something like \"The tone is between having and not having.\" That's a bit abstract. Then the second part: \"Aslında far olarak değil de far bazı gibi kullanılabilir.\" Which means \"Actually, it can be used as a far (light) instead of some other term.\"\n\nHmm, the user is talking about a product, maybe a light or something related to lighting. They mention that the tone is between having and not having, which might indicate ambiguity or uncertainty. Then they say it's more like a far (light) rather than another term. The use of \"far\" here could be a typo for \"fark\" (difference), but maybe it's intentional.\n\nLooking at the sentiment, the user isn't clearly positive or negative. They're pointing out that the product can be used in a certain way, but there's some confusion or ambiguity (\"varla yok arası\"). The second part seems to suggest an alternative use, which might be neutral. There's no strong positive words like \"harika\" (great) or negative words like \"zehirlendim\" (poisoned).

So their experience isn't based on actual use. The main reason for purchasing is the positive feedback from others. Words like \"çok övülüyor\" (praising a lot) indicate a positive sentiment towards the product, but since they haven't tried it themselves, there's no personal experience.\n\nNow, considering the labels: POSITIVE would be if they had a good experience, NEGATIVE if they had a bad one, and NEUTRAL if there's no clear positive or negative feeling. Here, the user is mentioning others' praise, which is positive, but their own experience isn't evaluated yet. However, the act of purchasing based on others' recommendations might lean towards a positive intent, but since they haven't used it, the sentiment isn't confirmed.\n\nBut wait, the instruction says to analyze the text's sentiment. The user hasn't had a negative or positive experience themselves. They're just sharing their reason for buying, which is based on others' opinions. So the sentiment here isn't directly positive or negative from their own perspective.

Also, they say it does a great massage on nerve points, and there's a thumbs-up emoji.\n\nThe key positive words here are \"çok güzel\" repeated twice, and the emoji👍 which is a positive indicator. The user is highlighting the product's effectiveness in different uses and its ability to provide a good massage. There's no negative language or complaints mentioned.

The period before the exclamation might indicate confusion or a mistake.

The word \"harika\" is clearly positive. In Turkish, when someone says something is harika, they're expressing a positive feeling. There's no negative words here, and it's not neutral because \"harika\" is a strong positive adjective. So the label should be POSITIVE.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other nuances.

Then \"pişman oldum\" translates to \"I regretted,\" which clearly shows dissatisfaction. The last part \"almayın derim\" is advising others not to buy, which reinforces the negative sentiment.\n\nThere's no positive language here.

The user wrote, \"Uç kısmını yapmak izle ama yine de güzel.\" Translating that to English, it's something like, \"Watch the end part, but still good.\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment here. The phrase starts with a negative note: \"Uç kısmını yapmak izle\" which might be pointing out a flaw or something not done well. But then there's \"ama yine de güzel,\" meaning \"but still good.\" \n\nSo there's a contrast here. The user is pointing out a negative aspect but follows it up with a positive remark. In sentiment analysis, when there's both positive and negative elements, the overall sentiment can be tricky. However, the presence of \"güzell\" (good) might tip the scale towards positive, even though there's a criticism.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user is being neutral? They mention a flaw but also acknowledge the good parts. However, in many cases, if the overall tone ends on a positive note, it might be considered positive. But I need to check the rules again. The tags are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL.\n\nThe key here is that the user is giving both negative and positive feedback. If the majority of the sentiment is positive, but there's some criticism, does that make it neutral? Or does the presence of any positive element override the negative?\n\nLooking at examples: In the sample given, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" translates to \"Okay for the price,\" which is neutral. So if the text has both positive and negative elements without a clear majority, it's neutral.\n\nIn this case, the user points out a negative part (\"Uç kısmını yapmak izle\") but then says \"yine de güzel\" (still good). This seems like a mixed sentiment, but since there's no strong dominance of one over the other, and the overall message is that despite the flaw, it's still good. That might lean towards positive because the conclusion is positive.\n\nWait, but maybe not. If someone says \"It has some issues, but still good,\" that could be neutral. However, in many contexts, ending on a positive note would make it positive. But I need to be careful here. The instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. \n\nAnother angle: the user is giving feedback with both negative and positive aspects. If the sentiment is mixed but not clearly one or the other, then NEUTRAL might be appropriate. However, if the overall sentiment is more positive than negative, it's POSITIVE.\n\nBut how to determine that? The phrase \"yine de güzel\" (still good) suggests that despite the criticism, the user still finds it good. That could indicate a positive sentiment overall. But maybe not. It depends on the context of the product or service being reviewed. However, without more context, I have to rely on the text itself.\n\nIn some cases, \"but still good\" might be considered neutral because there's both criticism and praise. But in others, it could be seen as positive because the user is acknowledging the good despite the flaws. \n\nLooking at the examples again: The sample where the text was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (Okay for the price) was labeled NEUTRAL. That's a case of mixed sentiment but leaning towards neutral. Similarly, here, if the user is pointing out a flaw but still saying it's good, maybe that's considered positive because they're giving an overall positive assessment despite some negatives.\n\nAlternatively, if the main point is the criticism, then it might be negative. But the presence of \"güzell\" (good) might make it more positive. \n\nI think in this case, since the user ends with a positive statement (\"yine de güzel\"), even though there's a negative part, the overall sentiment is positive. Therefore, the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

They're advising others not to purchase the product because it doesn't work. The use of \"hiç etkisi yok\" is a strong negative statement, indicating that the product failed to meet expectations.

The text is: \"İlk kullanımımda hoşuma gitti fakat diğer kullanımlarımda yüzümde pütür pütür bir etki yaptı anlam veremediğim bir şekilde.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content.

However, they mention subsequent uses caused an unpleasant effect on their face (\"yüzümde pütür pütür bir etki yaptı\") and they couldn't understand it (\"anlam veremediğim bir şekilde\"). \n\nThe key here is the contrast between the initial positive experience and the negative effects later on.

Even though there's a positive part at the beginning, the overall tone seems more negative due to the adverse reaction mentioned.\n\nI should check if there's any ambiguity. The user might be neutral if they're just stating facts without strong emotions, but the use of \"hoşuma gitti\" (liked) and the negative description of the effect suggests a mix. However, in sentiment analysis, when there's a clear negative outcome despite an initial positive note, the overall label is usually negative. \n\nAlso, considering the example given where a mixed statement like \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled neutral, but here the negative impact is more significant.

The smiley face \":)\" also reinforces a positive emotion.\n\nThere's no negative language here. The user isn't complaining or expressing dissatisfaction.

The key words here are \"çok iyi\" which means \"very good\" in Turkish. They mention that their skin was treated very well. \n\nNow, considering the context. When someone says something was done very well, especially regarding a service like skincare, it's usually a positive statement. There's no negative language here. Words like \"harika\" (great) or \"iyi\" (good) are positive indicators. The repetition of \"çok iyi\" emphasizes the positive aspect.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but in Turkish, unless there's a clear indicator like irony or context suggesting otherwise, straightforward statements like this are taken at face value.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user wrote, \"Çok steril bir paketleme olduğunu düşünmüyorum ama işimi görüyor :)\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence. The first part is \"Çok steril bir paketleme olduğunu düşünmüyorum,\" which translates to \"I don't think it's very sterile packaging.\" That sounds negative because they're pointing out a lack of sterility, which might be a concern for some people.\n\nBut then there's the second part: \"ama işimi görüyor :)\" The word \"ama\" means \"but,\" so this is a contrast. \"İşimi görüyor\" translates to \"it gets the job done.\" The smiley face \":)\" adds a positive tone here. So even though they mention the packaging isn't very sterile, they're saying it still works for their needs.\n\nNow, considering the overall sentiment. The first part is negative, but the second part is positive. However, in sentiment analysis, we often look at the dominant emotion or the overall context. Since they acknowledge that despite the lack of sterility (which could be a negative point), the product still functions well, which is a positive aspect. The use of the smiley also indicates a positive feeling.\n\nBut wait, sometimes people might have mixed feelings. However, the instruction says to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. If there's a clear dominant sentiment, that should be chosen. Here, even though they mention a negative point, the overall message is more about it working despite that. So maybe the sentiment leans positive because the main takeaway is that it works, and the smiley reinforces that.\n\nAlternatively, if both parts are equally weighted, but in this case, the second part seems to be the conclusion. The user might be saying that even though they don't think the packaging is very sterile (which could be a minor negative), the product still does its job well, which is positive.

Then they comment on the reviews being exaggerated, which implies that the product might not be as good as people say. Both parts of the sentence express dissatisfaction.\n\nLooking at the labels: POSITIVE is for happy or satisfied comments, NEGATIVE for unhappy or critical ones, and NEUTRAL for indifferent or neutral statements.

The phrase \"yok\" means there is none. So the sentence is stating that something lacks brilliance.\n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The absence of a positive trait like brilliance could be negative. But I need to check if the context implies a negative sentiment. Since the user is pointing out the lack of something positive, it's likely a negative statement. However, sometimes in Turkish, depending on the context, it might be neutral. But here, since \"parlaklık\" is a positive attribute and saying there's none of it would typically be seen as negative.\n\nLooking at the rules again: POSITIVE if the text has positive sentiment, NEGATIVE if negative, NEUTRAL otherwise.

The user wrote, \"Ürün güzel gibi fakat kargolanma süresi çok uzundu.\" Translating that to English: \"The product seems good but the shipping time was very long.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The first part is positive (\"güzel gibi\" means \"seems good\"). However, the second part uses \"fakat\" which is \"but,\" indicating a contrast. The negative part is about the shipping duration being too long (\"çok uzundu\").\n\nNow, according to the rules, I have to determine if the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Since there's both a positive and a negative aspect, but the user is pointing out a significant drawback (shipping time), which might outweigh the positive comment. However, sometimes in such cases, it's considered mixed, but the options here are only POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nBut wait, the instructions say to use the labels provided. The example given for similar cases where there's both positive and negative elements: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which translates to \"Okay considering the price,\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. So maybe when there's a mix but not strongly negative or positive overall, it's neutral.\n\nHowever, in this case, the user mentions a product that seems good (positive) but has a long shipping time (negative). The presence of both could lead to NEUTRAL. But sometimes, if one part is more emphasized, it might lean towards negative. However, since the user didn't express strong dissatisfaction beyond the shipping time, maybe it's still neutral.\n\nAlternatively, if the main point is the negative aspect, but the positive comment is just a minor note, then maybe NEGATIVE. But I need to check examples again. The example with \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral because it's a balanced view. Similarly here, the user has both positive and negative points, so NEUTRAL might be appropriate.\n\nBut wait, another angle: if the product is good but shipping was bad, maybe the overall sentiment is still positive because the main product aspect is good. However, the shipping time could be a significant factor for some users. But according to standard sentiment analysis practices, mixed sentiments are often labeled as neutral unless one part strongly dominates.\n\nIn this case, since both aspects are mentioned without strong emphasis on either, NEUTRAL seems correct.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

So that part is negative. Then there's \"ama iyi\", which is \"but good\". \n\nSo the user is saying something isn't very useful, but then mentions it's good. The mixed sentiment here. But according to the rules, I need to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there's both negative and positive aspects, but no clear dominance. However, in such cases, if the overall sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative, NEUTRAL might be appropriate. Wait, but sometimes \"ama\" (but) can indicate a contrast where the second part is more important. But here, it's not clear which part is stronger. The user says it's not very useful (negative) but good (positive). Since both are present without clear emphasis, maybe NEUTRAL is the right label here. Alternatively, if the positive part is a counterpoint to the negative, but since they're separate aspects, it might be neutral overall.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Even though they tried to find a solution by choosing a larger size, it still didn't work out.

The first part says \"yorumlara güvenerek aldım\" which translates to \"I bought based on reviews.\" Then \"hediyeler için teşekkür ederiz\" means \"thank you for the gifts.\" So far, that's positive.\n\nBut then there's \"ama dolgunlaştırıcı dolgunlaştırmadı\". The word \"ama\" is \"but,\" indicating a contrast. \"Dolgunlaştırıcı\" might be a product name or a term related to something that's supposed to be enriching or filling. The phrase \"dolgunlaştırmadı\" means \"did not make it full\" or \"didn't enrich.\" So the user is saying that despite the positive aspects, the product didn't meet expectations in terms of being fulfilling.\n\nPutting it all together: the user had a mixed experience. They thanked for the gifts and trusted the reviews, but the product didn't deliver on its promise. This seems more negative than positive because the main issue (the product not working as intended) is highlighted with the contrast word \"ama.\" Even though there's gratitude, the overall sentiment is likely negative due to the disappointment expressed.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Words like \"normal\" suggest neutrality, and there's no explicit complaint or praise. So the sentiment is likely neutral.\n\nI should check if there are any hidden emotions.

The word \"yağlı\" (oily) can have different connotations depending on context. In some cases, oily hair might be seen negatively, like if someone is criticizing the hair's condition. But here, it's a statement of fact without any obvious negative or positive words. The verb \"gösteriyor\" suggests that the oiliness is being pointed out, but there's no explicit emotion attached.\n\nLooking at the examples given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral because it's a balanced statement about price. Similarly, this sentence is stating an observation without expressing approval or disapproval.

Translating that to English, it's something like \"I think you need to use it for a long time, it's not bad but hasn't created a significant difference yet.\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The user starts with \"sanırım\" which means \"I think,\" indicating some uncertainty. Then they say \"kötü değil\" which is \"not bad,\" so that's a positive note. However, they follow it with \"ama belirgin bir fark da yaratmadı henüz\" meaning \"but hasn't created a significant difference yet.\" The word \"ama\" introduces a contrast, suggesting some disappointment or lack of impact.\n\nSo there's a mix of neutral and slightly negative elements. The user isn't outright negative but points out that the product hasn't made a noticeable difference. However, they also mention it's not bad. But since the overall sentiment leans towards the product not being effective yet, even though it's not bad, the dominant feeling here might be more on the neutral side because there's no strong positive or negative emotion.

They haven't finished the first box yet and might change their mind after it's done. Right now, they only say it strengthens their hair.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment here. The user is giving a mixed review. On one hand, they mention that their hair has strengthened, which is a positive point. However, they also note that they can't recommend the product specifically and are still in the middle of using it. They mention breaking ampoules, which might indicate some issues with the product's quality or application method. But the main point is that they're seeing some benefit but aren't fully convinced yet.\n\nThe key here is whether the overall sentiment leans more positive, negative, or neutral. The user isn't overly negative; they acknowledge a positive effect (hair strengthening) but also express reservations. Since they haven't finished the product and are uncertain about recommending it, the sentiment might be neutral. They're not entirely satisfied, but there's a positive aspect mentioned. However, the fact that they can't recommend it despite some benefit might tip it towards negative. But considering the uncertainty and the mention of a positive effect, maybe neutral is more accurate.\n\nWait, the user says \"saçlarımda güçlenme söz konusu fakat özellikle bunu alın diyemem.\" So they're saying there's strengthening but can't recommend it. That seems like a mixed sentiment. However, in terms of overall sentiment classification, if the majority of the review is neutral with some positive and negative elements, but no strong emotion, then \"NEUTRAL\" might be appropriate. The user isn't expressing clear satisfaction or dissatisfaction; they're just reporting their experience without strong positive or negative words.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The key words are \"güzel\" (good), \"hoşuma gitti\" (I liked it). Both of these are positive indicators. The mention of \"yağlılık olmadığı\" (not greasy) is a positive aspect because the user is pointing out a favorable quality. There's no negative language here, just a positive experience.\n\nNow, checking if there's any ambiguity. The sentence structure is straightforward. The user is expressing satisfaction with the product's texture and lack of greasiness. No sarcasm or hidden meanings that might flip the sentiment. \n\nComparing to the examples given: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" (The food was amazing) is positive, similar to this case. The example for neutral was about price, which isn't relevant here. So, this clearly falls under POSITIVE.\n\nNo need to consider NEUTRAL because there's a clear expression of liking.

The user wrote: \"henüz iki kere kullandım etkisi kısa süreli oldu, fakat saçtaki türüncülasmalari götürdüğü söylenebilir , memnun kaldm\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the sentiment here. The person mentions they've used the product twice and the effect was short-lived. That sounds negative. But then they say it can be said that it removes the dandruff in the hair, and they're satisfied.\n\nSo there's a mix of positive and negative points. However, the overall tone seems to lean towards neutral because despite the short duration, they are satisfied with the result. The key here is whether the satisfaction outweighs the negative aspect or if it's balanced. Since they mention being satisfied (\"memnun kaldm\"), that might tip it slightly positive. But I need to check the rules again.\n\nThe user instructions say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The example where there's a mix but overall satisfaction is considered positive. However, in this case, the negative point (short duration) and the positive (removes dandruff and satisfied) are both present. But the user might be neutral because they're not overly happy or unhappy. Wait, but the last part says \"memnun kaldm\" which means they are satisfied. That's a positive sentiment. Even though there's a negative aspect, the overall conclusion is satisfaction. So maybe it's POSITIVE.\n\nWait, but sometimes in Turkish, \"memnun kaldım\" can be a strong indicator of positive sentiment. The fact that they mention being satisfied despite the short duration might mean the positives outweigh the negatives. However, some might argue it's neutral because there are both pros and cons. But according to the examples given, if there's a mix but the user ends on a positive note (satisfied), it should be POSITIVE. Let me check the example again: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is NEUTRAL. So when there's a balanced view, it's neutral. Here, the user has both negative and positive points but ends with satisfaction. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main point is that they are satisfied despite the short duration. The key is whether the overall sentiment is more positive.

Another example: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" is positive. If someone says \"Yemek iyi ama pahalıydı,\" that would be neutral. In this case, the user has a negative point (short duration) but also a positive outcome (removes dandruff and satisfied). The satisfaction might make it positive.

The word \"Bİ\" might be a typo for \"BİR\", which is Turkish for \"a\". Also, \"ETKSİNİ\" could be a misspelling of \"ETKİSİ\" (effect). So the corrected sentence might be \"ÇOK BİR ETKİSİ GÖREMEDİM.\" which translates to \"I couldn't see any effect.\"\n\nNow, analyzing the sentiment. The user is saying they didn't notice any effect, which could be negative if they were expecting one. However, without context, it's a bit tricky. But in many cases, not seeing an expected effect might lead to a negative sentiment. Alternatively, if the product was supposed to have an effect and it didn't, that's negative. But maybe the user is neutral because they're just stating a fact. Wait, but \"ÇOK\" (very) at the beginning intensifies the statement. So \"I couldn't see any effect at all.\" That sounds more negative. However, sometimes people use such phrases without strong sentiment. Hmm.\n\nBut looking at the example given in the instructions: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. So if the user's text is similar to that, maybe it's neutral. But here, the user is expressing a lack of effect, which might be negative. However, I need to check if there's any positive or negative words. The main verb is \"göremedim\" (couldn't see), which is neutral in itself. The intensity word \"çok\" could lean towards negative. But without more context, it's safer to go with NEUTRAL unless there's a clear indicator of positive or negative sentiment.\n\nWait, but the user might be implying that the product didn't work, hence negative. However, if they're just stating they couldn't see an effect, maybe they are neutral. It's a bit ambiguous. But in Turkish, \"etkisi\" refers to effectiveness.

The user is pointing out that the product isn't as good as it could have been, which leans towards a negative sentiment.\n\nHowever, there's a mention of \"sadece iyi\" (just okay), which might suggest neutrality. But the overall context is about unmet expectations and disappointment. The use of \"maalesef\" (unfortunately) emphasizes the negative aspect. Also, the comparison to Aveda implies that without using another product, the review would have been better, but now it's just average.\n\nConsidering all these elements, the sentiment here is more negative than neutral because the user is expressing disappointment and the product doesn't meet their expectations. The key phrases like \"çok iyi denilecek bir ürün değil\" clearly indicate a negative judgment.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The person is talking about something being so low quality that they threw it away and didn't even bother returning it. Words like \"kalitesiz\" (low quality) and \"direk attım\" (threw it directly) indicate a negative sentiment. Also, not wanting to return it suggests dissatisfaction.\n\nLooking at the rules, I have to use only POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.

There's no positive language here, just strong negative terms.\n\nI should make sure not to add any extra information. Just the JSON label. Let me double-check if there's any neutral aspect, but \"pazar malı gibi\" (like market goods) and throwing it away are strong indicators of negativity.

The first part is positive: \"günlük kullanıma uygun\" means appropriate for everyday use, which is a good thing. But then there's \"biraz tozutuyor,\" which translates to \"a bit dusty.\" That's a negative point.\n\nNow, the challenge is figuring out whether the overall sentiment is more positive, negative, or neutral. The user is pointing out both a positive aspect and a negative one. However, in many cases, when there's a mix of positive and negative but no clear dominance, it might lean towards neutral. But sometimes, if one part outweighs the other, it could be positive or negative.\n\nIn this case, the positive part is about suitability for daily use, which is a key factor for products like clothing or items that need to be worn regularly. The negative part is about being dusty, which might affect the product's quality or appearance. However, the user uses \"biraz\" (a bit), which softens the criticism. \n\nConsidering that both aspects are present and neither seems to overpower the other significantly, the overall sentiment might be neutral.

It's stating a fact that if you recognize its functionality, you might consider taking it. There's no strong positive or negative emotion here, just a factual statement.\n\nCombining both parts, the overall sentiment is leaning towards negative because the first part sets a negative expectation, and the second part doesn't counterbalance that with any positive aspects.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the text \"Daha ince yapamazlarmış\". I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Daha ince\" means \"thinner\" or \"more delicate\". \"Yapamazlarmış\" is a bit tricky. The verb \"yapmak\" means \"to make\" or \"to do\", and \"yapamaz\" is the negative form of \"yapabilir\" (can do). The suffix \"-larmış\" adds a sense of hearsay or something that's been heard before, like \"they say\" or \"it seems\".\n\nPutting it together: \"They say they can't make it thinner.\" So the speaker is stating that according to what they've heard, the product or thing in question cannot be made any thinner. \n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The sentence itself is a statement of fact based on hearsay. There's no explicit positive or negative emotion here. It's more of an observation or information relayed from others. The user isn't expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction; they're just reporting what they've heard. \n\nSo, the label should be \"NEUTRAL\" because there's no clear positive or negative sentiment expressed. It's a factual statement based on someone else's claim.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user wrote, \"Henüz denemek ama ürün bandrollü ve güzel paketlenmiş.\" Translating that to English, it means something like, \"Not tried yet, but the product is branded and well packaged.\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment here. The key parts are \"henüz denemek\" (not tried yet), \"ürün bandrollü\" (branded product), and \"güzel paketlenmiş\" (well packaged). The user hasn't used the product yet, so there's no direct experience with its quality or performance. However, they mention positive aspects like being branded and well-packaged. \n\nNow, considering the sentiment labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The user isn't expressing a negative opinion, but they also aren't giving a full positive review because they haven't tried the product. The mention of branding and packaging is neutral in terms of the product's actual use but could be seen as slightly positive. However, since the main part of the sentence is about not having tried it yet, the overall sentiment might lean towards NEUTRAL. \n\nWait, but sometimes people might consider the positive aspects even if they haven't used the product. But in this case, the user is stating that they haven't tried it, so their opinion is based on appearance rather than experience. The labels are strict here. If there's no clear positive or negative sentiment expressed beyond neutral observations, then NEUTRAL would be appropriate.\n\nSo, the answer should be NEUTRAL because the user hasn't provided a definitive positive or negative judgment about the product's performance or quality, only its branding and packaging.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user wants only JSON output with the label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since the text clearly expresses a negative sentiment, the correct label here is NEGATIVE.

Let me double-check the example given. The example for \"Zehirlendim.\" (I got poisoned) was labeled NEGATIVE, which makes sense.

The word \"güzel\" is clearly positive. The phrase \"her zaman oldugu gibi\" suggests that the beauty has remained consistent over time. There's no negative language here.

The text is: \"En azından yüzümdeki yağlanmadan kurtuldum yine siyah noktalarım derinde olmasına rağmen az çekti\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context and the emotions expressed here. The user mentions \"yağlanmadan kurtuldum,\" which translates to \"I got rid of my oily skin.\" That's a positive outcome because they're relieved about their skin condition.\n\nHowever, there's another part: \"siyah noktalarım derinde olmasına rağmen az çekti.\" Translating that, it means \"my black spots are deep but I didn't pull them much.\" The mention of black spots (which could be acne or blemishes) might indicate some concern. But the phrase \"az çekti\" suggests they didn't have to deal with them too much, which is a positive note.\n\nNow, considering the overall sentiment. The first part is clearly positive about getting rid of oily skin. The second part talks about black spots but in a way that's not overly negative. They mention the spots are deep, but the fact that they didn't have to pull them (maybe referring to extraction or treatment) could be seen as a relief. \n\nHowever, there's a slight contradiction here. The user is happy about one aspect (oily skin gone) but mentions an ongoing issue with black spots. But since the overall tone seems more relieved and positive, even though there's a minor negative point, the dominant sentiment might still be positive. Alternatively, if the mention of black spots is causing some concern, maybe it's neutral. \n\nBut looking at the example given in the instructions, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. That's a case where the user is okay with something but not overly happy or sad. In this text, the user is expressing relief about one thing (oily skin) and a minor issue with black spots. The overall sentiment might lean towards positive because the main concern (oiliness) is resolved, even if there's another issue. \n\nAlternatively, if the presence of black spots is causing some dissatisfaction, maybe it's neutral.

The user wrote, \"Herhangi bir faydasını göremedim daha idare eder.\" Translating that to English, it means something like, \"I couldn't see any benefits; it's manageable.\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment here. The phrase \"herhangi bir faydasını göremedim\" translates to \"couldn't see any benefits,\" which sounds negative. But then there's \"daha idare eder,\" meaning \"it's manageable\" or \"can be handled.\" \n\nSo, the user is expressing that they didn't find any advantages, but they're also saying it's manageable. The first part is negative, but the second part might be neutral or even slightly positive. However, overall, the sentiment seems to lean towards negative because the main point is the lack of benefits. The \"idare eder\" part might indicate acceptance rather than a positive feeling.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but the text seems straightforward. The user didn't find any benefits, which is a clear negative statement. Even though they mention it's manageable, that doesn't counteract the initial negative sentiment about the lack of benefits. \n\nSo, the label here would be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

However, they say it felt a bit light to them, implying it wasn't very high quality. They also mention it seems like it might rust soon.\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment keywords.

But then there's \"biraz hafif geldi\" (felt a bit light), \"çok kaliteli gelmedi\" (didn't seem very high quality), and \"paslancak gibi duruyor\" (seems like it might rust). These are negative points. \n\nThe user is expressing both positive and negative aspects, but the overall tone seems more negative because the criticisms about quality and potential rusting are significant concerns.

First, I need to understand the content thoroughly.\n\nThe text starts with \"Aman aman müthiş diyemem ama kötü bir üründe değil...\" which translates to something like \"I can't say it's amazing, but it's not a bad product...\" So there's some hesitation here, maybe neutral or slightly negative. Then they mention the product was smaller than expected (\"tahmin ettiğimden daha küçüktü\"), which could be a negative point. However, they praise the cap design (\"şişesi çevirmeli kapak bu yönü en güzel olanıydı\") and packaging (\"paketlemeside gayet güzeldi\"). But then they say they didn't like the closure feature (\"kapatma özelliğini çok beğenmedim\") and mention maybe needing a different shade (\"belki bir ton koyusunu almam gerekiyordu\"), which adds to the negative aspects. They also note their skin type (\"buğday tenliyim\") and that they bought the nude version, which might be relevant but not directly affecting sentiment.\n\nNow, considering all these points: there are both positive (cap design, packaging) and negative elements (size, closure). The user seems to have mixed feelings. However, the overall tone isn't strongly positive or negative. They acknowledge some positives but also several negatives. Since the instructions say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL, and given that there's a balance of both, maybe it leans more towards NEUTRAL. But I need to check if the negatives outweigh the positives or vice versa. The user starts with hesitation, mentions some drawbacks but also appreciates certain aspects.

The text is: \"Açıkcası pek beğenmedim herhangi hiçbir etkisini görmedim parfümlüydü kolusu güzel ama olmasını da istemem\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The person starts with \"Açıkcası pek beğenmedim\" which translates to \"Honestly, I didn't like it much.\" That's a negative statement right there. Then they mention not seeing any effect (\"herhangi hiçbir etkisini görmedim\"), which reinforces the negative sentiment. \n\nNext, they say \"parfümlüydü kolusu güzel\" – \"the collar was nice and fragrant.\" This part is positive. However, the following phrase \"ama olmasını da istemem\" means \"but I don't want it to be like that.\" This seems contradictory. They liked the collar's fragrance but overall didn't like the product.\n\nThe key here is determining the overall sentiment. Even though there's a positive note about the collar, the main sentiment expressed is negative due to the initial statement and the lack of effect mentioned.

The sentence has two parts connected by \"ama,\" which means \"but.\" The first part is \"Çok minik,\" which is negative because \"minik\" means very small, and in context, that might be seen as a drawback. However, the second part is \"rengi güzel,\" meaning \"the color is nice,\" which is positive.\n\nNow, the challenge is to figure out if the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The use of \"ama\" suggests a contrast. The user is pointing out a negative aspect (size) but then highlighting a positive one (color). Depending on the context, this could be neutral because it's balancing both aspects. However, sometimes in such cases, if the positive part is more emphasized, it might lean towards positive. But here, since both are mentioned without clear emphasis on either, it's likely neutral. The user isn't strongly expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction overall; they're just stating two facts about the product (assuming this is a product review).

Negative sentiment here too.\n\nThen: \"sisirilmis bir ürünmus malesef.\" Which is \"Unfortunately, it's a counterfeit product.\" The word \"malesef\" (unfortunately) adds to the negative tone.

The word \"GüZel\" has uppercase letters in the middle, which is unusual but not necessarily a typo. In Turkish, \"güzel\" means beautiful, so the capitalization here might be intentional for emphasis.\n\nNext, I should consider the context. The text is \"GüZel ürün\", which translates to \"Beautiful product\". The word \"ürün\" means product. Since the user is talking about a product and using a positive adjective, this seems like a positive sentiment. However, I need to make sure there's no sarcasm or hidden meaning. But given the straightforward structure without any negative words or context clues suggesting sarcasm, it's safe to assume it's positive.\n\nLooking at the rules again: only JSON output, no markdown, and using the specified labels. The example given for \"Yemek harikaydı.\" was labeled POSITIVE, so similar logic applies here. The key is the presence of a positive adjective modifying the product. No negative words are present, so it's not NEGATIVE.

Even though \"memnun\" itself is positive, the absence of it (not being satisfied) makes the overall sentiment negative.\n\nI need to make sure there's no ambiguity. Are there any other possible interpretations? Maybe if the context was different, but in isolation, this clearly indicates dissatisfaction. So the correct label here is NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Then \"bir renk tavsiye ederim\" means \"I recommend a color.\" So the person is saying they highly recommend a natural color.\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"gayet\" is definitely positive, and \"tavsiye ederim\" (I recommend) is also a positive action. There's no negative language here. The sentiment seems to be positive because they're endorsing something as natural and making a recommendation.\n\nWait, could there be any ambiguity? Maybe if \"doğal\" had a different context, but in this case, it's about color, which is likely referring to a product or service. So the user is satisfied enough to recommend it.

They mention that the item arrived as expected, which indicates satisfaction. However, they also express a hope that it doesn't break, which introduces a slight concern or uncertainty.\n\nBut in terms of overall sentiment, the main points are gratitude and meeting expectations. The part about hoping it doesn't break might be more of a neutral or slightly negative note, but since the primary emotion here is thanks and satisfaction, the dominant sentiment is positive. \n\nI need to check if there's any strong negative language. Words like \"bozulmaz\" (doesn't break) could imply a fear of malfunction, but it's not a direct complaint. The user isn't expressing dissatisfaction with the product or service; they're just cautious. \n\nSo, considering the main sentiment is positive due to the thanks and meeting expectations, even though there's a minor concern, the overall label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The word \"sekerli\" translates to \"sugary\" in English. The phrase is talking about a sweet smell.\n\nNow, considering the context, when someone mentions a sweet scent, it's usually a positive thing. People generally associate pleasant smells with positive experiences. However, I should check if there's any negative connotation here. In some cases, overly sweet might be seen as bad, but in most contexts, especially when describing a smell, \"sweet\" is positive.\n\nLooking at the examples given earlier: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" was positive, \"Zehirlendim.\" was negative, and \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral.

The text is: \"çok güzel bir ürün cildim hemencecik emiyor yağlı bir his kesinlikle bırakmıyor\". \n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The first part is \"çok güzel bir ürün\" which translates to \"a very beautiful product.\" That's clearly positive. Then \"cildim hemencecik emiyor\" – \"hemencecik\" might be a typo or slang.

However, the user might be saying that even though it doesn't absorb immediately, it doesn't leave an oily feeling, which is positive.

If it's supposed to be \"hemen hemen emiyor,\" meaning \"almost doesn't absorb,\" that might be a negative point, but the rest is positive. However, in Turkish skincare reviews, not leaving an oily feeling is a strong positive. The user might be emphasizing that despite not absorbing quickly, it's still good. So maybe overall positive? But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, if \"hemencecik\" is a typo for \"hemen hemen,\" then the product doesn't absorb well (negative) but doesn't leave oiliness (positive). The user might be neutral because there are both pros and cons. But the initial statement is very positive. Hmm. Maybe the main sentiment is positive, with some minor negative points but overall positive. Or maybe the user is saying that it's a good product even though it doesn't absorb quickly but doesn't leave oiliness. So I think the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

They're recommending a product and assuring satisfaction.\n\nThen there's a mention of \"Merve Özcan's recommendation.\" Since the user is citing someone else's advice, it adds credibility. But does that affect the sentiment? Probably not directly; it's more about the source of the recommendation rather than the sentiment itself.\n\nLooking for negative words: There are none here.

The verb is \"önlüyor,\" which means prevents or stops. The adverb \"gerçekten\" emphasizes that it's really effective. So the sentence is saying that the product effectively prevents body odor.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment. Preventing body odor is a positive outcome because people generally want to avoid unpleasant smells. The use of \"gerçekten\" adds a strong positive connotation, indicating satisfaction with the product's effectiveness. There's no negative language here, just a clear benefit mentioned. So the sentiment should be positive.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Then the second part: \"hep böyle kaliteli olmasını diliyorum.\" Translating that, it's something like \"I always wish for it to be this quality.\" The word \"kaliteli\" is \"quality,\" so they're expressing a desire for continued high quality. \n\nLooking at the sentiment labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. Since the user is expressing satisfaction and a positive wish for the brand's continued quality, this seems clearly positive. There's no negative language here. The user isn't complaining or showing any dissatisfaction. Even though they mention a desire for something (which could be neutral), the overall context is positive because they're happy with the current state and want it to continue. \n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but in Turkish, the direct translation doesn't suggest that.

That sounds like a complaint about the longevity of the perfume. If someone expects a perfume to last longer, and it's not doing so, that's likely a negative experience.

The word \"kapatıcı\" means something like \"closing\" or \"shutting\", and \"değil\" is \"not\". So the sentence translates to \"Ultura is not closing\" or \"Ultura isn't shutting\".\n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The user is stating that Ultura is not closing. Depending on context, this could be positive or negative. If someone is saying a place isn't closing, maybe they're relieved, which would be positive. But if the expectation was for it to close and it's not, maybe that's negative. However, without more context, \"kapatıcı değil\" directly translates to a negation of something being closed.

The person is talking about a product (probably a skincare item) that made their skin soft and had a peeling effect. Then they say there's no need to spend money on expensive ones.\n\nBreaking it down: \"yumuşacık yaptı\" is positive, indicating the product worked well. \"Peeling etkisi bıraktı\" also sounds positive, as peeling is often desired for exfoliation. The last part \"pahalılarına para vermenize gerek yok\" translates to not needing to spend on expensive ones, which could be neutral or slightly negative if they're comparing it to others, but here it's more about value for money.\n\nThe overall sentiment seems positive because the user is highlighting the product's effectiveness and affordability.

However, in some contexts, it might be neutral. But since there's no clear positive or negative sentiment here, maybe it's neutral. Wait, but sometimes colors can carry emotional weight. Pale copper might be seen as dull compared to bright colors. However, without more context, like if it's describing a product, art, or something else, it's hard to tell. The user examples show that \"fiyatına göre okey\" is neutral. So maybe this is similar. There's no explicit positive or negative words here.

The first part says \"Çok beğindiğim bir ürün,\" which translates to \"A product I really like.\" The word \"beğendiğim\" is a strong positive indicator. Then, \"Saçları yumuşacık yapıyor\" means \"Makes my hair soft,\" which is another positive statement about the product's effect. Finally, \"Tavsiye ederim\" is \"I recommend it,\" which is a clear endorsement.\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"beğendiğim\" (like), \"yumuşacık\" (soft, which is a positive descriptor), and \"tavsiye ederim\" (recommend). All these are positive sentiments. There's no negative language here. The user is expressing satisfaction with the product and even recommending it to others. \n\nI need to make sure there's no sarcasm or hidden meaning. In Turkish, sometimes people might use phrases that seem positive but have a negative connotation, but in this case, everything seems straightforward. The words used are all positive affirmations.\n\nSo, based on the analysis, the sentiment should be labeled as POSITIVE. There's no ambiguity here.

The user mentions \"kalıcı koku sıfır\" which means \"no permanent smell,\" which could be a positive point if they're talking about a product not having an odor. But then they say \"sakın almayın\" which is \"don't buy it,\" and \"paranız çöpe gıtmesin\" meaning \"your money will go to waste.\" These are strong negative statements.\n\nEven though the first part might seem positive, the overall sentiment here is clearly a warning against buying the product. The user is advising others not to purchase it because they think it's a bad deal. So the dominant emotion here is negative. The mention of money going to waste indicates dissatisfaction or regret, which are negative emotions.\n\nI need to make sure there's no ambiguity. The structure of the sentence starts with a possible positive aspect but quickly shifts to a strong recommendation against purchasing. In such cases, the overall sentiment is determined by the latter part, especially since the user is cautioning others. Therefore, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, translating the sentence helps. It says, \"It caused acne on me because my skin is sensitive.\" The key words here are \"sivilce\" (acne) and \"hassas\" (sensitive). Acne is generally a negative outcome, especially when it's caused by something else. The person is explaining that their sensitive skin led to acne. \n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The user is talking about a negative effect on their skin. Even though they mention the cause (sensitive skin), the result is still negative. There's no positive language here, just stating an adverse effect. So this should be labeled as NEGATIVE.\n\nWait, but sometimes people might use neutral if it's just a statement of fact without strong emotion. However, in sentiment analysis, mentioning a problem or negative outcome usually leans towards negative. The user isn't expressing satisfaction, so it's not positive. Neutral would be more like a factual statement without any emotional charge. But here, the mention of acne is a negative experience. So NEGATIVE makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The words \"umarım\" (I hope) and \"inanıyorum\" (I believe) show a positive outlook. They're expressing optimism about the outcome. Even though they mention just starting, there's no negative language here. Words like \"etkisini görürüm\" (see its effect) imply anticipation of a positive result.\n\nLooking at the sentiment tags: POSITIVE is for clear positive statements, NEGATIVE for negative ones, and NEUTRAL for neutral or mixed. Here, the user is hopeful and believes in the product's effectiveness. That's definitely a positive sentiment. No negative words are present, so it's not NEGATIVE.

The phrase \"bir ürün\" means \"a product,\" so the sentence is saying \"A very good product.\" \n\nThere's no negative language here. The user isn't complaining or expressing dissatisfaction.

So, the key points here are that they're a regular user but notice an unusual amount of lather.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment. The user isn't explicitly saying something negative, but there's a hint of concern because the product is behaving differently than usual. Words like \"bayağı köpürüyor\" (a lot of foam) and \"normalde bu kadar köpürmezdi\" (normally doesn't create this much foam) suggest that they're noticing a change which might be unexpected.\n\nHowever, there's no direct complaint about the product's quality or effectiveness. They might just be pointing out an observation without expressing dissatisfaction. On the other hand, if the excessive lathering is causing them inconvenience or not meeting their expectations, that could lean towards negative. But since they don't mention any negative consequences like skin irritation or waste of product, it's more of a neutral observation.\n\nSo, considering the lack of explicit positive or negative sentiment and just an observation about a change in product behavior, the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user wrote, \"Güzel ancak morlukları çok kapatmıyor.\" Translating that to English, it's something like \"It's nice, but the purple ones don't close properly.\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment here. The sentence starts with a positive word: \"Güzel\" means beautiful or nice. That's a positive adjective. However, the second part uses \"ancak,\" which is a conjunction meaning \"but\" or \"however,\" indicating a contrast. Then there's a complaint about the purple ones not closing properly. \n\nSo, the structure is positive followed by a negative point. The user is pointing out a flaw despite the initial positive remark. In sentiment analysis, when there's a mix of positive and negative elements, but the overall tone leans more towards one. Here, the negative part seems to be a significant issue because it's about functionality (not closing properly), which might be more critical than the aesthetic aspect mentioned first.\n\nBut wait, the user might be referring to something like clothing or items with purple parts. The fact that they mention \"morlukları\" (purple parts) not closing could be a specific problem. However, the initial positive statement is about the overall appearance (\"güzel\"). \n\nIn such cases, the presence of both positive and negative elements can lead to a neutral sentiment if the negatives are significant enough to counterbalance the positives. But sometimes, the primary sentiment is determined by the strongest part. Here, the negative aspect might be more impactful because it's a functional issue, whereas the positive is about appearance. \n\nBut I need to check the rules again. The user provided examples where \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. That's a case where the sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative but a middle ground. In this case, the text has both positive and negative elements. However, the presence of \"ancak\" (but) often indicates that the following part is more important. So maybe the overall sentiment is negative because the problem mentioned is a drawback. \n\nAlternatively, if the user is giving a mixed review, but in terms of classification, sometimes these are considered neutral. But according to the examples given, when there's a mix, it might depend on which part is stronger. However, the example with \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral because it's a balanced statement. \n\nIn this case, since the user starts with positive but then points out a significant issue, maybe the overall sentiment is negative. But I'm not sure. Another approach is to see if the negative part is a strong enough complaint to make the whole sentence negative. If the product is \"güzel\" but has a functional problem, it might be considered negative because the problem affects usability. \n\nAlternatively, if the user is just pointing out a minor flaw in an otherwise good product, maybe neutral. But I think the key here is that the negative part is a direct criticism of a feature (not closing properly), which could be more impactful than the aesthetic positive. So leaning towards NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Now, I need to determine the sentiment here.\n\nFirst, \"fena\" means bad or unpleasant. But the sentence structure is negative because of the \"değildi\" part, which negates the adjective. So, saying \"it wasn't bad\" is a way of expressing that the experience was at least acceptable, maybe even positive. However, in Turkish, this kind of phrasing can sometimes be neutral or slightly positive depending on context.\n\nBut according to the rules given, I need to check if it's positive, negative, or neutral. The example provided for \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. Similarly, \"Fena değildi\" is a negation of a negative statement, which usually leans towards positive or neutral. However, in some contexts, it might be considered slightly positive because the speaker is indicating that it wasn't as bad as expected. But since there's no explicit positive language here, maybe it's more neutral.\n\nWait, but the user examples show \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" as neutral. So if someone says \"Fena değildi,\" which is a bit more positive than neutral, but not strongly so. However, in Turkish sentiment analysis, phrases that negate a negative can be tricky. Sometimes they are considered positive, sometimes neutral. But given the examples provided by the user, maybe \"Fena değildi\" would be considered NEUTRAL because it's not explicitly positive or negative. It's more of an indifferent statement.\n\nAlternatively, if the user says \"It wasn't bad,\" that could imply a slight positive sentiment. However, without more context, it's safer to go with neutral as per the examples given. The key is to follow the user's example where similar phrases are labeled as neutral.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

First, I need to understand what the user is saying here.\n\nBreaking down the sentence: \"bir yikadim\" might be a typo. Maybe they meant \"biri yikadım\"? Or perhaps \"yıkadım\" which means \"I destroyed\" or \"I ruined\". Then \"çekti\" could be \"drew\" or \"pulled\", but in context, maybe \"çekti\" is part of a phrase like \"çekti\" meaning \"he took\" or \"he pulled\". \n\nNext part: \"oldukça kalitesiz\" translates to \"very low quality\". Then \"diz izi yapiyor\" – \"diz izi\" is \"knee mark\" or \"crease\", and \"yapiyor\" means \"making\" or \"doing\". So putting it all together, maybe the user is saying something like \"I destroyed it, he took it, very low quality knee mark making\"? That doesn't make much sense. Maybe there's a typo in \"yikadim cekti\". Perhaps they meant \"bir yikadım çekti\" which could be \"one destroyed pulled\"?

But the first part is confusing. \n\nAssuming that the main point here is the mention of \"oldukça kalitesiz\" which is clearly negative. Even if the rest of the sentence is unclear, the presence of \"kalitesiz\" (low quality) is a strong indicator of a negative sentiment.

Then, \"paketlemede bir sorun yoktu\" translates to \"there were no issues with the packaging.\" No problems here, so that's neutral or slightly positive.\n\nPutting it all together, the user is expressing satisfaction with the product quality and delivery speed, and noting the absence of packaging issues.

Let's break it down sentence by sentence.\n\nThe first part is \"doğal bir yansima veriyor.\" The word \"doğal\" means natural, which is positive. \"Yansima\" could be a typo for \"yansıma,\" meaning reflection or response. So, \"natural reflection\" might be a positive statement, suggesting authenticity.\n\nNext: \"çok fazla tozutmuyor.\" \"Tozutmak\" is a Turkish slang term that can mean to annoy or bother.

However, in context, maybe it's \"sim sim\" as in a sound, but the phrase \"durmuyor\" means not stopping. The user is emphasizing that it doesn't stop at all (\"kesinlikle\"), which could be positive if they're talking about something continuous, like a feature working non-stop.\n\nPutting it all together: The text seems to praise natural reflection, lack of annoyance, and continuous operation.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The first part says \"göründüğü kadar büyük ve yapılı değil\" which translates to \"not as big and structured as it appears.\" That sounds a bit negative because they're pointing out that something isn't as impressive as it looks. But then there's \"ama yumuşaklığı çok iyi\" meaning \"but the softness is very good.\" The word \"ama\" introduces a contrast, so even though the first part might be negative, the second part is positive.\n\nNow, I need to decide which part has more weight. The user is mentioning both negatives and positives. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a mix but one part is strongly positive or negative, it might lean towards that. Here, \"yumuşaklığı çok iyi\" seems like a strong positive statement. But the first part is also a criticism. \n\nBut wait, maybe the overall sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative. It could be neutral because they're giving both pros and cons. However, sometimes in such cases, if one aspect is emphasized more, it might tip the scale. The use of \"ama\" (but) suggests that the speaker is pointing out a drawback but then highlighting a significant positive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because they are presenting two opposing views without a clear preference. But I need to check examples given earlier. For instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. That's a balanced statement. Similarly, here, the user is giving both negative and positive aspects. However, sometimes in Turkish, the structure might imply that the positive part is more important. \n\nWait, but the first part is about size and structure not being as expected, which could be seen as a negative. The second part is a strong positive about softness. So it's mixed. But according to the rules, if there's a mix, how do we decide? The examples given don't have such cases. Let me think again.\n\nIn some sentiment analysis models, when both positive and negative are present, it might be neutral. However, sometimes the presence of a strong positive can override the negative. But in this case, since they're contrasting two different aspects (size/structure vs. softness), maybe it's neutral because it's not clearly leaning towards one. \n\nAlternatively, if the user is saying that despite not being as big or structured, the softness is good, which could be a positive overall. But I'm not sure. The key here is whether the sentiment is more positive, negative, or neutral. Since there are both elements, but no clear dominance, maybe it's neutral. However, sometimes in such cases, people might consider the presence of a positive aspect as making it slightly positive. \n\nBut according to the example given where \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral, which is a balanced statement. Similarly, here, the user is giving both sides. So I think the correct label would be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user is talking about the smell (\"kokusu\") and says \"vikis gibi\" which translates to \"like vikis\" (maybe a brand or product name). Then they say \"deneyemedim daha\", which means \"I haven't tried yet\" or \"haven't been able to try yet\". \n\nThe structure here is that the person is comparing the smell to something else but hasn't actually experienced it themselves. The use of \"daha\" (yet) suggests that they are talking about a future action, not a current experience. Since they haven't tried it, there's no direct positive or negative sentiment expressed. They're just stating a comparison and their lack of experience.\n\nNow, considering the possible sentiments. If someone says they haven't tried something yet, it doesn't inherently convey positivity or negativity. It's more of a neutral statement because there's no evaluation of the product based on personal experience. The mention of \"vikis gibi\" might be a positive comparison if vikis is known for a good smell, but without context, we can't assume that. The user hasn't confirmed whether they like it or not; they're just stating their current state of not having tried it.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment here is neutral because there's no clear indication of approval or disapproval.

The word \"berbat\" translates to \"terrible\" or \"awful,\" which is a strong negative term. The user is talking about a product that's making their hair oily even after washing, and they're advising others not to buy it.\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"berbat\" is clearly negative. Then there's \"yağlandırıyor\" (makes oily) and \"yağlı\" (oily), which are also negative in this context because the user is complaining about oiliness. The phrase \"kesinlikle almayın\" means \"definitely don't buy,\" which reinforces the negative sentiment.\n\nI should check if there's any positive or neutral language, but I don't see any.

The user is expressing frustration with the app's usability.\n\nSecond part: \"ilk kullandığımda bir etkisini görmedim\" means \"when I first used it, I didn't see any effect.\" This indicates dissatisfaction with the app's performance or effectiveness. The user expected some impact but didn't notice any, which is another negative point.\n\nCombining both parts, the user is clearly expressing a negative experience.

In this case, it's saying that whatever product or service being discussed is ideal for people with short hair. That sounds like a positive statement because it's highlighting a benefit or suitability. However, I need to check if there's any context that might make it neutral or negative. Since the sentence is straightforward and doesn't contain any negative words or sarcasm, it seems like a genuine positive comment. The user might be reviewing a hair product, for example, and stating that it works well for short hair.

The user wrote: \"19 gün sonra geldi çok sukurrrr teşekkürlerlr bildiğimiz blistex iste seviyoruz kendisini 🥰\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the sentiment here. The words \"çok sukurrrr\" and \"teşekkürlerlr\" are expressions of gratitude. \"Sukur\" is a Turkish word meaning \"thank you\" or \"grateful,\" and the repetition with \"rrr\" might indicate emphasis or excitement. Then there's \"blistex iste seviyoruz kendisini 🥰\". Blistex is a brand, so they're mentioning it positively. The heart emoji adds a positive emotion.\n\nHowever, there's a part that says \"19 gün sonra geldi,\" which translates to \"It arrived after 19 days.\" That could be negative if the user was waiting for something and it took too long. But then they follow up with gratitude. So maybe the delay was frustrating, but they're happy now because it arrived.\n\nBut looking at the overall tone, the main sentiment seems positive. They are thanking someone, expressing happiness, and using a heart emoji. The mention of Blistex is neutral, just stating a fact. The initial part about waiting 19 days might be a minor negative point, but the overall message is gratitude and satisfaction. So I think the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The positive part is that the product meets their needs. The negative part is the burning sensation. However, the user also mentions that the issue resolves when using a sponge, which might indicate a workaround rather than a complete dissatisfaction. \n\nBut in terms of overall sentiment, the presence of a negative effect (burning) even if it's temporary could tip the balance towards negative. However, since they're still using the product and the problem is manageable, maybe neutral? Wait, but the initial part was positive. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user starts by saying their under-eye area isn't an issue and the product meets their needs. That's positive. Then they mention a side effect (burning), which is negative. But then they say it goes away when using a sponge. So maybe the negative aspect is temporary or manageable. \n\nIn sentiment analysis, if there's a mix of positive and negative but no clear dominance, sometimes neutral is used. However, in this case, the user is pointing out a problem even though they're satisfied with other aspects. But since the product still works for their main need, maybe it's more neutral? Or does the presence of a negative effect make it overall negative?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that they mention the issue but also find a solution (using a sponge) makes it neutral. Because the problem isn't insurmountable. However, some might argue that any adverse effect should be considered negative. But in this case, since it's resolved by using a sponge, perhaps the user is still satisfied enough to not rate it as fully negative.\n\nBut I need to check the rules again. The labels are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. If there's a mix but no clear dominance, maybe neutral? Or if the negative part is significant enough, even if resolved, it might be negative. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the user is using the product and the main need is met, but there's an inconvenience (burning), which they manage to fix.

The text is: \"Açık ton olmasına rağmen koyu geldi onun dışında yapısı ve yüzde kalıp gibi durmaması açısından başarılı.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sentence structure and the words used. Let's break it down.\n\n\"Açık ton olmasına rağmen\" translates to \"Despite being a light tone.\" The user is talking about something that was supposed to be light but came out dark (\"koyu geldi\"). Then there's \"onun dışında yapısı ve yüzde kalıp gibi durmaması açısından başarılı.\" Which means \"except for that, in terms of structure and not looking like a mold (kalıp), it's successful.\"\n\nSo the user is pointing out a negative aspect (the tone being too dark) but then mentions positive aspects (structure and not resembling a mold). The overall sentiment here seems mixed. However, the key part is whether the positive or negative elements dominate.\n\nThe phrase \"başarılı\" (successful) at the end indicates a positive outcome despite the initial issue. But the structure of the sentence starts with a negative point (\"koyu geldi\") and then moves to positives. In Turkish sentiment analysis, sometimes the presence of both negatives and positives can lead to neutral if they balance out, but here the conclusion is \"başarılı,\" which leans positive.\n\nHowever, I need to check if the overall sentiment is more positive or negative. The user might be critical of the tone but appreciative of other aspects. Since the final judgment is \"başarılı,\" it's a positive label. But wait, sometimes in Turkish, even if there are negatives mentioned, the overall sentiment can still be positive if the conclusion is favorable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is neutral because they mention both pros and cons. But the presence of \"başarılı\" suggests that despite the negative point, the overall assessment is positive. So I think it's POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Adi beğenmedim.\" Translating that to English: \"It leaves a lot of powder and the head part broke immediately. I didn't like it.\" \n\nFirst, looking at the keywords. \"Çok pudra bırakıyor\" means it's leaving a lot of powder, which is probably a negative point for a product like a hair tool or something similar. Then \"başlık kısmı hemen kırıldı\" translates to the head part broke immediately, indicating poor quality or durability. The last sentence \"Adi beğenmedim\" is \"I didn't like it,\" which clearly expresses dissatisfaction.\n\nSo all parts of the review are pointing out negative aspects: excessive powder, quick breakage, and overall dislike. There's no positive language here. Even though there's a neutral part about the product's feature (leaving powder), the context of it being a negative experience makes the sentiment negative. The user is clearly unhappy with the product's performance and quality. Therefore, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The context here is about a product, so the user is likely expressing satisfaction with it. There's no negative language or any neutral terms that might suggest indifference. The sentence is straightforward and clearly positive. \n\nI should check if there are any hidden nuances. Sometimes people might use sarcasm, but in this case, \"güzel ürün\" seems genuine. No indicators of sarcasm like excessive praise or context that contradicts the sentiment. \n\nComparing to the examples given: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" (The food was amazing) is positive, similar to this case.

Sadece cildi anlık olarak daha bir güzel görünmesini sağlıyor. Birazcık da nem veriyor.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user is talking about a product, probably a skincare item since they mention \"cildi\" (skin) and \"nem veriyor\" (provides moisture). The first part says \"Siyah noktalara hiç bir etkisi yok,\" which translates to \"It has no effect on the black spots.\" That sounds negative because it's saying the product doesn't address a specific concern.\n\nBut then the next sentence is \"Sadece cildi anlık olarak daha bir güzel görünmesini sağlıyor,\" meaning \"It only makes the skin look better temporarily.\" The word \"sadece\" (only) might indicate that the user is disappointed because they expected more from the product. However, the last part says \"Birazcık da nem veriyor,\" which is \"Also provides a bit of moisture.\" This is a positive point.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The first part is negative about not affecting black spots, but the latter parts mention temporary improvement and some moisturizing effect. However, the use of \"sadece\" might suggest that the user feels the product doesn't deliver on its main promise (treating black spots), leading to a more negative sentiment despite the positive aspects mentioned. Alternatively, if the product was expected to do more than just moisturize, the overall sentiment could be neutral or even slightly negative.\n\nBut considering the structure of the sentences, the first statement is a strong negative point, while the others are more neutral or slightly positive. However, in Turkish sentiment analysis, sometimes the context and emphasis matter. The user might be expressing disappointment that the product doesn't address black spots but still acknowledges some benefits. But since the main issue (black spots) isn't addressed, the overall sentiment leans towards negative.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Then \"tamamen hayal kırıklığı yaşatan\" translates to \"completely causing disappointment.\" Both phrases are strong indicators of a negative sentiment.\n\nI should check if there's any neutral or positive language, but in this case, all the words are negative.

Boydan kalıbı fazla küçük ve kumaşı tiftikli.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user is talking about a product, probably clothing, since they mention \"boydan kalıbı\" (size) and \"kumaşı\" (fabric). The first part says \"Çok basit duruyor,\" which translates to \"It looks very simple.\" That could be neutral or slightly negative depending on context. But in fashion, \"basit\" might not be a strong positive.\n\nNext, \"Boydaki kalıbı fazla küçük\" means the size is too small. That's definitely a negative point because it's an issue with fit. Then \"kumaşı tiftikli\" refers to the fabric being bumpy or rough, which is also a negative comment about quality.\n\nPutting it all together: The user is pointing out multiple flaws—simple design (maybe not a strong positive), incorrect sizing, and poor fabric quality. Even though \"basit\" might be neutral, the other two points are clearly negative. So the overall sentiment should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Then \"fiyatı da uygun\" translates to \"the price is also reasonable,\" which is another positive point. The phrase \"rengine bayıldım\" means \"I fell in love with the color,\" which is strongly positive. The emoji 😍 reinforces the positive emotion.\n\nThere's no negative language here.

The user wrote, \"çok bir kalite beklemeyin idare eder.\" Translating that to English, it means something like \"Don't expect too much quality; it's manageable.\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment here. The phrase \"çok bir kalite beklemeyin\" suggests that the speaker is advising others not to have high expectations about the quality. Then \"idare eder\" translates to \"it's manageable\" or \"it's okay.\" \n\nSo, the user is probably talking about a product or service that isn't of high quality but is still acceptable. The tone here seems neutral because they're not overly negative or positive. They're just stating a fact that the quality isn't great, but it's sufficient for what it is.\n\nI should check if there are any strong negative words. \"Idare eder\" might be slightly positive, but overall, the message is more about managing expectations rather than being enthusiastic or critical. The key here is that the user isn't expressing a strong emotion either way. They're just informing others that the quality is average and acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment should be neutral. There's no explicit praise or criticism, just an objective statement.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user is talking about a product (probably a hair care product) that made their hair soft on the first use. \n\nThe word \"mükemmel\" is clearly positive. Then \"yumuşacık yaptı saçlarımı\" indicates that the product had a beneficial effect on the hair, which is also positive. There's no negative language here.

The first part is positive: \"Paketlemesi çok iyiydi\" which means the packaging was very good. Then they mention \"naneli bir yapısı var\" (it has a minty structure) and \"dudağı parlak gösteriyor\" (makes lips look shiny). These are neutral or slightly positive, but not strongly negative.\n\nThe last part is \"bakalım işe yarayacak mı\" which translates to \"let's see if it works\" or \"let's see if it's effective.\" This part is more uncertain. The user is expressing doubt about whether the product will work despite the good packaging and minty structure. \n\nSo, there's a mix of positive comments and uncertainty.

But then there's \"ama genel olarak iyi bir krem\" meaning \"but overall, it's a good cream.\" The word \"ama\" indicates a contrast, so the user is pointing out a minor downside but still giving an overall positive assessment.\n\nSo the sentiment here is mixed. However, the instructions say to use only POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since the majority of the statement is positive (\"iyi bir krem\") despite the negative aspect mentioned, the label should be POSITIVE.

This might indicate that the product didn't work as expected, leading to frustration.\n\nPutting it all together, the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's effect on their hair and possibly the product's performance.

The word \"beğenmedim\" clearly expresses a negative feeling. Even though there's no explicit negative word like \"horrible\" or \"bad,\" the action of returning an item and stating they didn't like it strongly suggests a negative sentiment.\n\nI need to check if there's any ambiguity.

However, the second part says \"fakat güzelik görecelidir\" (but beauty is subjective). This introduces a neutral or even slightly positive note, suggesting that maybe others might find it beautiful.\n\nBut in sentiment analysis, we have to consider the overall tone.

The first part, \"tipik bir nemlendirici\" is neutral because they're just stating it's a typical moisturizer without any positive or negative adjectives. The second part, \"fazlası değil\" translates to \"nothing more,\" which could be slightly negative. It might imply that the product doesn't offer anything extra beyond the basics.\n\nBut wait, in Turkish, \"fazlası değil\" can sometimes be used neutrally to mean it's just average or meets expectations without being exceptional. However, depending on context, it could also carry a negative connotation if the user is disappointed.

The user wrote, \"Fiyatı uygun Biraz tozutuyor ama rengi güzel.\" Translating that to English: \"The price is reasonable, it's a bit dusty but the color is nice.\"\n\nFirst, I need to check each part for sentiment. \"Fiyatı uygun\" means the price is reasonable, which is positive. Then there's \"Biraz tozutuyor,\" which translates to \"a bit dusty.\" That's negative because it's pointing out a flaw. However, the next part is \"ama rengi güzel,\" meaning \"but the color is nice,\" which is positive again.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The user mentions both a negative aspect (dusty) and two positives (reasonable price and good color). But in Turkish, when there's a contrast like \"ama\" (but), sometimes the latter part can have more weight. However, the presence of both positive and negative elements might lead to neutral. Wait, but the example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey,\" which is more about being okay. Here, there are two positives and one negative. But maybe the user is satisfied overall despite the dust? Or does the negative aspect make it neutral?\n\nWait, in the examples provided by the user, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. So when there's a mix of positive and negative but no clear dominance, it might be neutral. However, here we have two positives (price is good, color is nice) and one negative (dusty). The negatives are minor (\"biraz\" - a bit), so maybe the overall sentiment is still positive? But I need to check if the user's intention was to express satisfaction despite the flaw.\n\nAlternatively, since there's both positive and negative elements, it might be neutral. However, in some cases, even with mixed sentiments, if the positives outweigh the negatives, it could be positive. But the instruction says to use the labels strictly based on the content. The example given for neutral was a balanced statement without clear positive or negative dominance.\n\nIn this case, since there are both positive and negative points, but no strong indication of one overriding the other, maybe NEUTRAL is appropriate. However, I should check if \"biraz tozutuyor\" is considered a minor issue that doesn't negate the positives. If the user is satisfied overall, it might be positive.

The person is talking about how after washing it once, the item reduced in size (swelling went down and it shrank). Then they gave it to their daughter.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The user mentions that the item shrank, which could be seen as a negative aspect if they were expecting it not to shrink. However, they also mention giving it to their daughter, which might indicate satisfaction with the result. But wait, shrinking after washing is usually a negative point for clothing items because it affects fit and size. The fact that they gave it to their daughter might be a positive action, but the main issue here is the shrinking.\n\nBut maybe the user is satisfied because the item shrank as expected? Or perhaps they are disappointed because it didn't hold up well. However, without more context, like whether the shrinkage was unexpected or not, it's tricky. But in general, shrinkage after washing is often considered a negative aspect unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, if the user intended for it to shrink (like a garment that's supposed to be washed before wearing), then maybe it's neutral. However, the mention of \"tengi soldu\" (swelling went down) might imply that there was some initial issue with swelling, which is resolved by shrinking. But I'm not sure if that's a positive or negative outcome.\n\nWait, in Turkish, \"tengi\" can mean swelling or puffiness. So the item had swelling, then after washing, it shrank and the swelling went down. Maybe the user was concerned about the swelling but found that after washing, it resolved. However, the shrinkage might still be a negative point. But since they gave it to their daughter, maybe they are okay with it.\n\nBut overall, the main points here are shrinkage and resolving swelling. Shrinkage is typically a negative aspect in clothing unless it's intentional. The resolution of swelling could be positive, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, since the user didn't express clear satisfaction or dissatisfaction beyond the facts stated, maybe it's neutral.\n\nAlternatively, if they are satisfied that after washing, the item is now suitable for their daughter, then it might be positive. But I think the key here is that the user is stating a fact without expressing an opinion. They just reported what happened.

The second part is a request, which is neutral on its own but in context might show impatience or dissatisfaction. However, there's no explicit negative language like complaints or strong negative words. It's more of a polite but firm request, so maybe leaning towards neutral.

Then there's \"bayağı gidecek,\" which might mean \"will go a long way\" or \"will last a long time.\" That sounds positive too.\n\nNext part is \"bir ürün idare eder.\" \"Idare etmek\" means to manage or handle. So putting it all together: \"A very big product that will go a long way and can be managed.\" \n\nWait, maybe the user is saying that the product is so large that it's manageable? Or perhaps they're implying that despite being big, it's easy to handle. That seems positive. But I should check for any negative words. The word \"bayağı\" can sometimes have a negative connotation, like \"too much,\" but in this context, it's paired with \"gidecek,\" which is more about duration. \n\nAlso, \"idare eder\" could mean that the product is manageable, which is a positive aspect.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user wrote, \"Ürünün kokusu çok güzel ama ben bir faydasını göremedim.\" Translating that to English: \"The product's smell is very nice but I couldn't see any benefits.\"\n\nFirst, the positive part is about the scent being pleasant. Words like \"çok güzel\" (very nice) are clearly positive. However, the second part uses \"ama\" (but), which introduces a contrast. The user mentions not seeing any benefits, which is negative. \n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The sentence has both positive and negative elements. But in sentiment analysis, when there's a contradiction, it often depends on which part is stronger. Here, the positive aspect is about the smell, which might be a minor feature, while the lack of benefits could be a major drawback. However, the user didn't express strong dissatisfaction; they just stated a fact. \n\nBut according to the rules, if there's a mix, how do we decide? The example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (Okay considering the price.) That's neutral because it's a balanced view. In this case, the user has both positive and negative points but doesn't strongly lean either way. However, the presence of a clear negative statement (\"ben bir faydasını göremedim\") might tip it towards negative. But maybe not, since the overall sentiment isn't overwhelmingly negative. \n\nWait, the examples given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. So if there's a mix but no strong emotion, it's neutral. Here, the user has a positive comment and a negative one. However, the negative part is about not seeing any benefits, which could be a significant issue. But maybe the overall sentiment isn't strongly negative because the user didn't use strong words like \"kötü\" (bad) or \"memnun değilim\" (not satisfied). They just stated they couldn't see benefits. \n\nAlternatively, if the positive and negative parts are balanced, it might be neutral. However, sometimes in such cases, the dominant sentiment is considered. But since both aspects are present, maybe it's neutral. The user isn't overly happy or unhappy; they have mixed feelings. Therefore, the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The next part is \"kenarları pürüzsüz yapıyor\" which means it makes the edges smooth. \n\nSo the user is talking about a product (nail hardener) that makes the edges smooth. The word \"güzel\" is clearly positive. The rest of the sentence describes the product's function in a neutral way, but since \"güzel\" is used, the overall sentiment leans positive.

The words used are \"belli olmuyor\" which is negative because it's saying the color isn't visible. \"Çok seffaf\" means \"very transparent,\" which might be a positive trait in some contexts, but here it's causing an issue. The user is probably disappointed because the transparency is making the product (maybe clothing or something else) not show the intended color.\n\nSo even though \"seffaf\" could be neutral or positive, in this context, it's leading to a negative experience.

The user wrote, \"güzel ama stick aydınlatıcıları keşfedince kullanımı daha zor geldi.\" Translating that to English: \"It's nice but when I discovered the stick lighters, using them became more difficult.\" \n\nFirst, the sentence starts with \"güzel\" which means \"nice\" or \"good,\" so that's a positive sentiment. However, the second part introduces a problem: discovering the stick lighters made usage harder. The conjunction \"ama\" (but) indicates a contrast between the initial positive statement and the subsequent negative experience.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The user is expressing both a positive aspect (\"güzel\") and a negative one (\"kullanımı daha zor geldi\"). But in sentiment analysis, especially when there's a contrast, the dominant emotion often depends on the context. Here, the initial positive comment is followed by a negative experience. However, the use of \"ama\" suggests that the negative part is a drawback to the initially positive aspect.\n\nBut wait, the user might be saying that despite the product being good, the discovery of stick lighters made it harder to use. So the main sentiment here could be neutral because there's both a positive and a negative point, but they are not strongly conflicting. Alternatively, if the negative part is more impactful, it might lean towards negative. However, since the user starts with a positive statement and then mentions a difficulty, it's possible that the overall sentiment is neutral because it's a mixed experience without a clear dominant emotion.\n\nBut I need to check the rules again. The tags are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. If there's a mix of positive and negative but no clear dominance, NEUTRAL might be appropriate. However, sometimes in such cases, if the negative part is a consequence of the positive, it could still be considered negative. But I think here, since both aspects are present without one overpowering the other, NEUTRAL is the right choice.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

They mention not using any other foundation or BB cream for two years and that this is the only BB cream that doesn't cause acne. The key words here are \"sivilce vs yapmayan\" which translates to \"doesn't cause acne\" and \"tek bb krem\" meaning \"only BB cream\". \n\nThe user seems to be expressing satisfaction with a product because it's the only one they've used without causing acne, which is a positive outcome for them. However, I should check if there's any negative connotation. The mention of not using other products might imply that others did cause issues, but the focus here is on the current product being effective.\n\nThe sentiment here is likely positive because the user is highlighting the benefit of this particular BB cream in preventing acne, which is a positive attribute.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user wrote, \"Ürün güzel ama çabuk çıkıyor kalıcılığı en fazla 1 1,5 gün.\" Translating that to English: \"The product is nice but it comes out quickly, the durability is at most 1-1.5 days.\"\n\nFirst, they start with a positive note saying the product is good (\"güzel\"). That's a positive sentiment. However, then they mention that it doesn't last long (\"çabuk çıkıyor\") and specify the durability is only up to 1-1.5 days. This part is negative because it's pointing out a significant drawback.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The user has both positive and negative aspects. But in sentiment analysis, if there are conflicting sentiments, we usually look at the dominant one or the overall context. Here, even though they start with a positive comment, the main issue is about the product's short lifespan, which is a major negative point. However, sometimes \"but\" can indicate that the negative part is more critical. But in some cases, if the positive and negative are balanced, it might be neutral.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which translates to \"Okay considering the price,\" implying a neutral stance because it's acceptable despite some drawbacks. In this case, the user is pointing out a significant negative aspect (short durability) but also mentions the product is good. However, the negative part might outweigh the positive. But maybe the overall sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative; it's mixed. However, according to the rules, if there's a mix, how do we decide?\n\nLooking at the examples again: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" (Positive), \"Zehirlendim.\" (Negative), \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (Neutral). The third example is neutral because it's a balanced view. In this case, the user says the product is good but has a major flaw. However, the presence of both positive and negative might lean towards neutral if they are equally weighted. But sometimes, the negative aspect could be more impactful. Alternatively, maybe the overall sentiment is negative because the main issue (durability) is a critical factor.\n\nBut I need to check if there's a clear dominant sentiment. The user starts with \"güzel\" but then immediately contrasts it with a significant downside. In such cases, sometimes the sentiment is considered negative because the negative aspect is more impactful. However, other times, if both are present and not clearly dominant, it might be neutral.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both positive and negative elements makes it neutral. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The user is expressing that the product is good but has a problem. So they're giving a mixed review. In such cases, the label would be NEUTRAL if the sentiments are balanced. However, sometimes the presence of a strong negative can make it NEGATIVE even with a positive note.\n\nBut according to standard sentiment analysis practices, when there's both positive and negative elements without clear dominance, it's considered neutral. For example, \"The product is good but expensive\" would be neutral. Similarly here, \"güzel ama çabuk çıkıyor\" – the user is giving both sides. So maybe NEUTRAL is appropriate.\n\nBut wait, in the examples provided by the user, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. That's a case where there's a positive aspect (okay considering the price) but no explicit negative. However, in our case, there's both positive and negative. So maybe it's neutral.\n\nAlternatively, if the negative part is more significant, like \"The product is good but breaks after one day,\" that might be considered NEGATIVE because the main issue is a critical flaw. But I'm not sure. It depends on the context of the analysis. Since the user hasn't specified any particular weighting for positive vs. negative, maybe it's safer to go with NEUTRAL when both are present.\n\nBut another angle: The initial positive statement might be overshadowed by the negative aspect. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. In some cases, people might say \"it's good but...\" and still have a neutral sentiment overall. So I think in this case, NEUTRAL is the correct label.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Then \"normal nemlendirici\" is \"a regular moisturizer\". So putting it together, the user is saying that the product is just a normal moisturizer without any additional benefits.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The phrase \"ekstrası olmayan\" might imply that the product doesn't have any special features, which could be seen as negative if they were expecting something more. However, the word \"normal\" here might indicate that it's standard or meets basic expectations. There's no explicit positive or negative language, just a factual statement about the product's lack of extras.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in reviews, saying something is \"normal\" without any negatives could be neutral. However, if someone is pointing out that there are no extras, maybe they were hoping for more, which could lean towards negative.

The first part is \"Duştan sonra kullanınca bütün kiri alıyor.\" Translating that, it means \"When used after a shower, it removes all the dirt.\" The words here are positive: \"alıyor\" (removes) and \"bütün kiri\" (all the dirt), which suggests effectiveness.\n\nNext sentence: \"Siyah noktaları azaltıyor.\" Translating to \"It reduces black spots.\" Again, this is a positive effect, indicating that the product helps with skin issues. The verb \"azaltıyor\" (reduces) is a good sign here.\n\nThird part: \"Haftada bir kez kullanıyorum.\" Which means \"I use it once a week.\" This seems neutral. It's just stating frequency of use without any positive or negative connotation. \n\nPutting it all together, the user is talking about the product's effectiveness in removing dirt and reducing black spots, which are positive aspects.

The negative aspects are the fabric being thin and irritating. However, the user also states they won't return it, which could indicate some level of satisfaction despite the issues. But the main points here are the complaints about the product's quality. Even though there's a mention of not returning, the overall tone seems more negative due to the problems with the fabric.

But since there are both positive and negative elements, how do I determine the overall label?\n\nLooking at the rules, the labels are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.

Since both aspects are present and neither seems to overpower the other, the overall sentiment might be neutral. \n\nHowever, sometimes if one part is more significant, it could tip the scale.

So maybe the user meant \"Alınması gereken bir makyaj malzemesi\" which is \"A makeup product that needs to be taken\".\n\nNow, analyzing the sentiment.

The phrase \"güzel\" translates to \"nice\" or \"beautiful,\" which is a positive adjective. However, the context is about putting something on the shelf to give to the mother. The action of placing it on the shelf might imply that the item isn't being used immediately but is being saved for later.\n\nBut the key part here is the use of \"güzel\" which directly indicates a positive sentiment towards the item. Even though there's an action of putting it away, the main sentiment expressed is positive because the user is highlighting the quality of the item as good for mothers. The reason for putting it on the shelf doesn't negate the positive feeling about the product itself.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden negative meaning, but in Turkish, sarcasm isn't as commonly indicated here without additional context.

The user is saying that despite the price, the scent is good. There's no negative language here. Even though it's comparing to price, the adjective used is positive.

It's repeated with extra 'ş's for emphasis, which usually indicates strong positive sentiment. Then there's \"güzel\", which means beautiful or good. Both of these are clearly positive adjectives.\n\nNext part: \"bir koku alan\". That translates to \"a scent area\" or maybe \"a place with a fragrance\". Not sure about the exact context here, but combined with the previous words, it seems like they're talking about a pleasant smell. \n\nThen \"pişman olmaz\" means \"won't regret\" or \"you won't be sorry\". The use of \"olmaz\" (will not) adds to the positive sentiment because it's saying that choosing this option won't lead to regret.\n\nThere's also an emoji 👍🏼, which is a thumbs up. That's definitely a positive symbol.\n\nPutting it all together: The user is expressing strong approval and satisfaction with something related to a pleasant scent or fragrance. All the words and the emoji point towards a positive sentiment. No negative words are present here. Even \"pişman olmaz\" reinforces the positive by saying there's no regret. \n\nI don't see any ambiguity here. The language is clearly enthusiastic and complimentary.

The user mentions that the reviews are exaggerated, which could be negative. But then they talk about \"orta karar\" (medium decision) and \"uygun fiyatli\" (reasonable price), which might be neutral or positive.\n\nWait, but the first part is pointing out a flaw in the reviews, saying they're exaggerated. That's a negative point. However, the rest of the sentence seems to be more about the product being reasonably priced, which could be a positive aspect. But the user isn't directly praising the product; they're just stating that the price is reasonable. \n\nHmm, but the overall sentiment here might be neutral because the user is giving a balanced view. They mention both the exaggerated reviews (negative) and the reasonable pricing (positive), but there's no strong emotional language. The key is whether the overall tone leans more towards positive, negative, or remains neutral.\n\nThe phrase \"orta karar\" suggests a middle ground, which is neutral. Combining that with \"uygun fiyatli\" (reasonable price) might not be strongly positive.

However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a clear negative outcome or dissatisfaction despite initial positives, it might lean negative. But sometimes neutral can be if it's mixed without strong emotions.\n\nWait, but the user is pointing out a failure in long-term effectiveness. That's a significant drawback. Even though there was a positive aspect initially, the main issue here is that the product didn't deliver on lasting results. So the overall sentiment might be negative because the primary function (long-term cleaning) wasn't met. However, some might see it as neutral if both sides are equally weighted. But in many cases, when a product fails to meet expectations after initial success, it's more negative. Let me check the rules again. The tags are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The example for neutral was \"fiyatına göre okey\" which is like \"okay for the price.\" So maybe if there's a mix but no strong sentiment, it's neutral. But here, the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the long-term effectiveness. That seems more negative. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe neutral because they're pointing out both pros and cons.

If it's removing something negative like blemishes or imperfections, that's positive. But if it's removing something desirable, maybe negative. However, in context, products that remove imperfections are usually seen positively.

So the label should be NEGATIVE.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other possible interpretations. Maybe in some contexts, but here it's straightforward. The user is complaining about something being very low quality. So the correct label is definitely NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user is talking about makeup removal. They mention that it's not a deep cleanser, but you can use a makeup remover water first and then wash with this product.\n\nNow, looking for keywords or phrases that indicate sentiment. Words like \"derinleme temizleme\" (deep cleaning) might be negative if the product isn't effective. However, the user says it's not about deep cleaning, which could be neutral. Then they mention using a makeup remover water first and then washing with this product. The tone here seems to be giving instructions or suggesting a method rather than expressing dissatisfaction.\n\nThe conjunction \"ama\" (but) might indicate a contrast, but in this case, the user is explaining a process. There's no clear positive or negative emotion expressed. They're just stating facts about how to use the product. \n\nSo, considering all that, the sentiment seems neutral.

Then \"ama daha sonra hemen geçiyor\" translates to \"but then it quickly goes away\".\n\nSo the user is talking about something that initially has a certain effect (maybe a product's whitening) but then disappears quickly.

Words like \"geçiyor\" (goes away) might indicate dissatisfaction.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's neutral? If they're just stating a fact without strong positive or negative emotions. However, the use of \"ama\" (but) suggests a contrast between initial effect and subsequent disappointment. That leans more towards negative. \n\nI should check for any positive words. The first part mentions something positive (\"yüzde beyazlik birakiyor\"), but the second part is negative.

The user wrote, \"uygun fiyatlı ama kalıcı değil.\" Translating that to English, it's \"good price but not durable.\" So the first part is positive about the price being good, but the second part is negative about durability.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The user is pointing out both a positive and a negative aspect. However, in sentiment analysis, if there are conflicting sentiments, we usually look at which one is stronger or more dominant. Here, the negative part (\"not durable\") might be more significant because it's a common concern for products. People often prioritize durability over price, so the negative aspect could outweigh the positive.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user is just stating both points without emphasizing one over the other. The structure uses \"ama\" which means \"but,\" indicating a contrast. In such cases, the sentiment might lean towards negative because the second part introduces a drawback that contradicts the first positive point. However, some analyses might consider it neutral if both aspects are equally weighted.\n\nLooking at the example given in the instructions: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" translates to \"Okay for the price,\" which is neutral. Similarly, here, the user is giving two opposing views. But since one is a positive and the other is negative, the overall sentiment might be considered negative because the criticism (not durable) is a stronger factor in product satisfaction. Alternatively, if both are equally important, it could be neutral.\n\nHmm, but I need to follow the rules strictly. The user's instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. If there's a mix, but one is more dominant, go with that. However, if they're balanced, then NEUTRAL. In this case, \"uygun fiyatlı\" (good price) is positive, and \"kalıcı değil\" (not durable) is negative. The use of \"ama\" suggests the negative part is a drawback that might make the overall sentiment more negative. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's neutral because both aspects are presented without clear emphasis on one over the other.\n\nWait, looking at the examples again: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is NEUTRAL. So if the user says something like \"good price but not durable,\" that might be similar to \"okay for the price\" which is neutral. However, in this case, the negative aspect is more explicit. But maybe the model should consider both parts and decide based on the overall sentiment.\n\nAlternatively, since there's a direct contradiction between positive and negative aspects, it could be considered NEUTRAL because they cancel each other out. But I'm not certain. Another approach is to see which part is more impactful. If someone says \"good price but not durable,\" the negative aspect might make the overall sentiment negative. However, in some contexts, people might consider both factors and end up with a neutral stance.\n\nI think the safest bet here is to go with NEGATIVE because the user is pointing out a significant drawback (not durable) despite the good price. The presence of \"ama\" emphasizes that the negative part is a problem that outweighs the positive aspect.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Breaking that down: \"kalite\" is quality, \"fiyat performansi\" is price performance, and \"tek geçerim\" might be a typo. Maybe they meant \"tek sevdiğim\" (the only one I like) or \"tek geçerli\" (the only valid one). Assuming it's \"tek sevdiğim\", the sentiment here is positive again, emphasizing that the product is the best in terms of quality and price.\n\nPutting it all together, the user is expressing continuous use and high praise for the product's quality and value.

The user starts by saying they're angry at themselves for not discovering the product earlier. That's a strong positive emotion. Then they mention that the product allows easy facial massage and that you can feel your face muscles working. These are positive points about the product's effectiveness. \n\nNext, they express hope that it's genuine and will help with their sinus issues, which is a bit of a neutral or cautious note, but overall still positive because they're hopeful. They also mention that it helped with their headache, which is another positive outcome. The ending is enthusiastic, saying they'll buy it for their daughters and recommend it.\n\nLooking for any negative words or phrases. There's \"kendime kızdım\" (angry at myself), but that's more about the user's reaction rather than a negative sentiment towards the product. The rest of the text is filled with positive experiences and recommendations. \n\nNo negative terms like \"hatalı\", \"kötü\", or anything similar are present.

Then there's \"kokusu güzel,\" meaning \"the smell is nice.\" That's also a positive comment, especially if it's about a product like food or something fragrant.\n\nSo both parts of the sentence are positive. There's no negative language here. The user is expressing satisfaction with both the delivery speed and the scent. Therefore, the overall sentiment should be positive.

The text is: \"ürün koyu mat siyah gibi durmasa da siyah gibi duruyor pek kahverengi değil ama sürülüşü yine de güzel\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user is talking about a product's color and application. They mention that even though it's not a deep matte black, it still looks like black and isn't too brown. Then they say the application is still good.\n\nBreaking it down: The first part has some negative aspects (\"koyu mat siyah gibi durmasa da\" – \"even if it doesn't look like a deep matte black\") and mentions it's not very brown (\"pek kahverengi değil\"). However, the latter part is positive (\"sürülüşü yine de güzel\" – \"the application is still good\").\n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The user points out some drawbacks but ends with a positive note about the application. Since the overall tone isn't strongly negative or positive, but there's a mix of both, the neutral label might be appropriate. However, I need to check if the positives outweigh the negatives or vice versa. Here, the negatives are specific to color perception, while the positive is about the application. The user seems satisfied enough with the application despite the color issues. But since there's no strong positive or negative sentiment dominating, neutral could be correct. Alternatively, maybe slightly positive because the final statement is positive. Wait, but the example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is more of a mixed feeling. In this case, the user has both criticisms and praise. So, according to the rules, if it's a mix without clear dominance, it's neutral. Therefore, the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Both of these are negative statements. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with a product or service, probably related to hair care. \n\nThe emoji used is 👎, which is a thumbs down, reinforcing the negative sentiment. There's no positive language here, just complaints about lack of benefits and a negative effect on their hair. \n\nSo, based on the rules provided, the label should be NEGATIVE.

The phrase \"fiyat uygun\" is a positive statement because it's expressing satisfaction with the price. However, I should check if there's any context that might change this.

The text is: \"Burada büyük kutu gibi görünüyor ama küçük kutusu görseldekiyle alakası bile yok ama kokusu kıvamı çok güzel\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The person is talking about a product, probably a box or container. They mention that it looks like a large box but the small one in the image isn't related. Then they say the smell and texture are very good.\n\nBreaking it down: The first part has some negative aspects (\"görseldekiyle alakası bile yok\" which means there's no relation to the image, implying maybe a discrepancy or disappointment). However, the latter part is positive (\"kokusu kıvamı çok güzel\" – the smell and texture are very good).\n\nNow, determining the overall sentiment. There's both negative and positive elements. But in Turkish, when there's a mix, sometimes the dominant emotion decides. Here, the user starts with a complaint about the image not matching but ends with a strong positive statement about the product's qualities. The positives might outweigh the negatives here. However, it's a bit tricky because there are two contrasting points. \n\nBut according to the rules, if there's a mix, maybe it's neutral? Wait, no. The example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is more of a balanced statement. In this case, the user has both negative and positive aspects. However, the overall sentiment might lean towards positive because the positive part is stronger or more impactful. Alternatively, if the negatives and positives are equally weighted, it could be neutral. \n\nBut in Turkish reviews, sometimes even if there's a complaint, the positive aspect can make the overall sentiment positive. For example, if someone says \"The product didn't look good in the picture, but the smell is amazing,\" they might still be satisfied. So maybe POSITIVE here. But I need to check the examples again. The user provided an example where a mix led to neutral. Wait, no: the example for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is more of a neutral statement about price. \n\nIn this case, the user has both negative and positive points. However, the presence of strong positives (\"kokusu kıvamı çok güzel\") might tip it towards POSITIVE. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the negatives are significant enough, maybe NEGATIVE. But the key is that the user ends on a positive note, which could indicate overall satisfaction despite the initial complaint. \n\nAnother angle: The structure of the sentence uses \"ama\" (but) twice. First, contrasting the appearance with the image, then again contrasting that with the smell and texture. So the main point is that despite the discrepancies in appearance, the actual product's qualities are good. That might lean towards positive because the user is highlighting the positives despite the negatives. \n\nSo I think the label here should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The words \"harika\" (great) and \"üçün\" (product) are positive indicators. There's no negative language here.

The user starts with \"ürün güzel\" which means \"the product is good,\" so that's a positive point. But then they use \"fakat\" which translates to \"but,\" indicating a contrast. The rest of the sentence talks about the sock not being like the model, being plain, cheap, and not durable (kayıyo katlanıyo might mean it slips or folds easily). \n\nSo there's a mix of positive and negative aspects. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a clear overall sentiment, even with some negatives, we have to determine the dominant one. Here, the initial positive comment is followed by several negative points about the product's quality and durability.

But here, the user is criticizing the product's quality and durability, which are significant aspects. The initial positive comment is about the product being good, but the negatives are more specific and detailed.

However, they add a caveat: \"aşırı yoğunluk beklememek lazım\" meaning you shouldn't expect excessive density. This part seems negative because it's warning against expecting something that might not be there.\n\nBut wait, the overall sentiment depends on how these parts balance out. The first two points are positive, but the last part is a negative note. However, the user isn't complaining about the product; they're just stating a fact that density shouldn't be expected.

Or does the warning tip it to negative?\n\nHmm, in sentiment analysis, even if there's a negative part, if the overall tone isn't strongly negative, it might still be positive or neutral.

That's a positive point. However, the user then says they returned the product the same day it arrived because of poor quality. The key negative aspect here is the return due to bad quality. Even though the price was good, the main issue here is the dissatisfaction with the product's quality leading to a return. In sentiment analysis, when there's a mix of positive and negative elements, but the overall outcome is negative (like returning a product), the dominant sentiment tends to be negative.

Then \"çok iyi\" means \"very good\". So the sentence is saying that according to many users, it's very good. That sounds positive.

The text is: \"Çok geç ulaştı elime ama avon a teşekkürler çok güzel bu koku ama bu kokunun kalıcılığını daha da arttırmalı\". \n\nFirst, I need to break it down. The sentence starts with \"Çok geç ulaştı elime\" which translates to \"It arrived very late to me.\" That's a negative point because the delivery was delayed.\n\nThen there's \"ama avon a teşekkürler\" meaning \"but thank you Avon.\" Here, the user is thanking Avon, so that's positive. \n\nNext part: \"çok güzel bu koku\" which is \"this scent is very nice.\" Definitely positive. \n\nBut then they say \"ama bu kokunun kalıcılığını daha da arttırmalı\" translating to \"but this scent's longevity should be increased even more.\" This is a suggestion for improvement, so it's a negative point because the user is pointing out a flaw.\n\nNow, balancing these elements. The positive aspects are gratitude and appreciation for the product's scent. The negatives are the late delivery and the wish for longer-lasting fragrance. \n\nIn Turkish sentiment analysis, sometimes the structure can be tricky with conjunctions like \"ama\" (but) which can reverse the sentiment. However, in this case, there are both positives and negatives. But since the user is expressing gratitude and liking the product despite the issues, maybe the overall sentiment leans more positive? Wait, but the last part is a criticism about the product's quality. \n\nHmm, but the main action here is thanking Avon and complimenting the scent, even though there's a negative point about delivery and longevity. However, the user might be focusing on the product itself rather than the service. The delivery issue is separate from the product's quality. So maybe the sentiment towards the product is positive, but the overall experience has negatives. But the task is to analyze the text as a whole.\n\nAlternatively, since there are both positive and negative elements, but the user ends with a suggestion for improvement rather than a strong complaint, perhaps it's neutral? Or does the presence of gratitude make it more positive?\n\nWait, looking at the example given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. So if there are mixed sentiments, maybe it's neutral. But in this case, the user has both positives (thank you, good scent) and negatives (late delivery, need for better longevity). However, the main focus might be on the product's scent being good despite the issues. \n\nBut I think the key here is that the user is expressing gratitude towards Avon and liking the product, even though there are some complaints. So maybe the overall sentiment is positive because the positives outweigh the negatives? Or is it neutral because there are both?\n\nAlternatively, in Turkish, sometimes the structure can have the main sentiment after \"ama\". But in this case, the user thanks Avon and says the scent is good, then suggests improvement. The suggestion might be a minor negative but not strong enough to make the whole sentiment negative. \n\nI think the correct label here would be NEUTRAL because there are both positive and negative aspects without one clearly dominating. However, if the gratitude and compliment are stronger, maybe POSITIVE. But I need to check examples again.\n\nIn the example given, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. So when there's a mix of sentiments but no clear dominance, it's neutral. Here, the user has both positive (thank you, good scent) and negative (late delivery, need for better longevity). Therefore, NEUTRAL might be appropriate.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Then there's \"birsey\" which is \"something\" in Turkish. Next, \"masaj\" is massage, so they're talking about a massage experience. The phrase \"olayi süper\" translates to \"the event was super\" or \"it was awesome.\" \"Süper\" is another strong positive term.\n\nPutting it all together: the user is saying that the massage was wonderful and awesome. Both \"harika\" and \"süper\" are clearly positive adjectives. There's no negative language here, just enthusiastic praise. Even though there might be a typo or grammatical error in the original text (like \"birsey\" instead of \"bir şey\"), the sentiment is still undeniably positive.\n\nI should make sure not to confuse any words.

Then \"sanırım benim cildime hitap etmiyor\" translates to \"I think it doesn't suit my skin.\" That's definitely a negative statement about the product's effectiveness. The last part, \"bir daha almam\" means \"I won't buy it again,\" which is a strong indicator of dissatisfaction.\n\nSo, combining these elements: the user is expressing that the product didn't meet their expectations in terms of size and suitability for their skin, leading to a decision not to repurchase. That's clearly a negative sentiment. There's no positive language here, just complaints and a negative outcome.

Translating that to English, it's something like, \"Not permanent but the ride is very easy 👍🏻\". \n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment here. The first part is \"Kalıcı değil\" which means \"Not permanent.\" That could be negative because it's pointing out a drawback or limitation. However, the second part is \"sürüşü çok kolay\" meaning \"the ride is very easy,\" which is positive. There's also an emoji 👍🏻, which is a thumbs up, reinforcing the positive aspect.\n\nNow, considering the rules for sentiment analysis here. The user might be talking about a product or service that isn't permanent (maybe temporary?), but the experience of using it is smooth and easy. The mixed feedback here: one negative point (\"not permanent\") and one positive (\"easy ride\"). But in many cases, if there's a mix, we have to see which part dominates. However, the instructions say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. \n\nBut wait, the user might be referring to something like a temporary solution that's easy to use. The negative aspect is \"not permanent,\" but the positive is about ease of use. Depending on context, but since there's no clear dominance of one over the other, maybe it's neutral? However, the presence of the thumbs up emoji suggests a more positive leaning. But the initial part is negative.\n\nWait, the example given for NEUTRAL was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which translates to \"Okay considering the price,\" implying that it's acceptable but not overly positive or negative. In this case, the user has both a negative and a positive point. However, in sentiment analysis, sometimes mixed sentiments can be neutral if they balance each other out. But I need to check if the overall tone is more positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main point here is that despite not being permanent (a drawback), the ease of use is a strong positive. So the user might be expressing a slightly positive sentiment because the positive aspect is emphasized with the emoji. However, it's possible that the negative part (\"not permanent\") could make it more neutral if both aspects are equally weighted.\n\nBut in many cases, when there's a mix but one part is clearly positive and the other is a minor negative, the overall sentiment might lean towards positive. But I need to be careful here. The instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. If it's a balance between both, maybe neutral? However, the example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey,\" which is more of an acceptance rather than a mix of positive and negative.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is pointing out a flaw but also a positive, maybe it's still considered neutral because there's no clear overall sentiment. But I'm not sure. Another angle: in Turkish, \"Kalıcı değil ama...\" could be seen as a concession, meaning that even though it's not permanent, the ride is easy. So the main point might be the positive aspect, making it more positive. However, without more context, it's tricky.\n\nBut according to standard sentiment analysis practices, if there are both positive and negative elements but no clear dominance, it might be neutral. But in this case, the presence of the emoji could tip it towards positive. Alternatively, maybe the user is expressing that despite a drawback (not permanent), the experience is good, so overall positive.\n\nHmm. I think I need to make a judgment here. Since there's both negative and positive elements but no clear dominance, and considering the emoji, perhaps it's more neutral? Or maybe positive because the positive aspect is emphasized with the emoji. But I'm not entirely sure. However, looking at the examples given: \"Fiyatına göre okey\" was neutral. In this case, the user has a negative point but also a positive one. If the overall sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative, then it's neutral.\n\nSo my conclusion is that the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The gratitude and the positive closing suggest overall satisfaction. However, there are clear criticisms about the product's design and delivery time. But since they didn't express strong dissatisfaction and ended on a positive note, it might lean towards NEUTRAL.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Yillardir kullaniyorum\" means \"I've been using it for years,\" which is a positive statement indicating long-term use. Then \"bayiliyorum\" translates to \"I'm happy\" or \"I like it,\" so that's definitely positive. The next part is \"keske eskisi gibi ucuz olsa,\" which is a bit tricky. \"Keske\" is like \"if only,\" and \"eskisi gibi ucuz olsa\" means \"as cheap as before.\" So the user is expressing a wish that it were cheaper than it used to be.\n\nPutting this together: The user has been using the product for years and is happy with it, but they're disappointed that it's not as affordable now.

First, I need to understand what this phrase means in Turkish.\n\nBreaking it down: \"Idare eder\" translates to something like \"it's manageable\" or \"it gets by.\" Then \"ne iyi ne kötü\" means \"neither good nor bad.\" So the whole sentence is expressing that the subject is just okay, not particularly positive or negative. \n\nNow, looking at the rules. The possible labels are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. Since the user is saying it's neither good nor bad, that points towards a neutral sentiment. There's no strong positive or negative words here.

The person is talking about their skin issues—specifically, they mention having a lot of cystic acne (kistik sivilce) and that wearing masks caused more breakouts. They also say that after using a mask, new pimples appeared and they felt very embarrassed (aşırı pişamanım). \n\nNow, looking at the keywords: \"o kadar kötü ki\" translates to \"so bad that,\" which is negative. Words like \"kistik sivilce\" are medical terms for severe acne, which is a problem. The mention of not wearing masks for a long time because they thought it would help the pimples go away, but then after using the mask, more pimples came up. This indicates frustration and dissatisfaction with the product or situation. \n\nThe emotional tone here is clearly negative. The person is expressing discomfort, embarrassment, and disappointment with their skin condition worsening despite trying to manage it.

In Turkish, \"kan oturmak\" can mean something like \"to settle down\" or \"to calm down,\" but here it might be used metaphorically to express frustration or that the situation is getting worse. \n\nPutting it all together, the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product not working and using a phrase that conveys frustration.

The word \"güzel\" is clearly positive. When someone describes a smell as good or beautiful, that's a positive attribute. There's no negative language here.

The negative part is about a defect, which might be more impactful, but the positive comment is also significant. \n\nBut according to standard sentiment analysis, if there are both positive and negative elements without clear dominance, it's considered neutral.

Then \"yakması dayanışcak düzeyde\" translates to something like \"the heat was unbearable level.\" The last part is \"bnm hoşuma gitti,\" which means \"it suited my taste\" or \"I liked it.\"\n\nPutting this together, the user is saying that despite the intense heat (which is usually a negative aspect), they found it pleasant. The key here is the contrast between the negative experience of the heat and the positive outcome of enjoying it. However, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards positive because the person ended up liking it even though the conditions were tough. But wait, \"dayanışcak düzeyde\" might imply that the heat was too much, which could be negative. Yet the conclusion is that they liked it. So maybe it's a mix, but the final judgment is positive. Alternatively, if the main point is the discomfort from the heat, it might be negative. But since they say it suited their taste, I think the overall sentiment is positive. However, there's ambiguity here. The user might be expressing that even though the heat was intense (negative), they still enjoyed it (positive). In such cases, the dominant emotion is usually the one at the end. So \"hoşuma gitti\" is a strong positive indicator. Therefore, the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

However, I should check if there's any context that might make this negative. But the sentence is straightforward—stating that the product doesn't contain aluminum and is natural.

The user wrote: \"hızlı ve ekonomik üründen son derece memnunum dermatoloğum önerdi 3 senedir kullaniyorum\". \n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The key words here are \"son derece memnunum\" which means \"extremely satisfied\". That's a strong positive indicator. Then they mention their dermatologist recommended it, and they've been using it for three years. Long-term use without any negative comments suggests satisfaction.\n\nThere's no negative language here. Words like \"hızlı\" (fast) and \"ekonomik\" (economic) are positive adjectives. The fact that a dermatologist recommended it adds credibility to the product, reinforcing the positive sentiment. \n\nI should check if there's any hidden sarcasm or context I'm missing, but in Turkish, the direct translation doesn't show any negative connotations.

The example given for a negative sentiment was \"Zehirlendim\" which is \"I got poisoned,\" so clearly negative.

The phrase \"Fena değil\" translates to \"Not bad,\" which is generally a positive or neutral statement. However, the context is important. The user mentions that it's useful when they're forced to stay home, which might imply that under normal circumstances, it's not ideal. \n\nBut looking at the structure of the sentence, the first part is \"Fena değil\" (not bad), and the second part explains a situation where it works. The overall sentiment seems more neutral because the user isn't expressing strong positive emotions but also isn't complaining. They're acknowledging that it's acceptable in a specific scenario.\n\nI should check if there are any negative words here. \"Mecbur kaldığında\" means \"when you have to stay home,\" which might be a negative situation, but the user is saying that in that case, it works. So the sentiment isn't negative; they're not complaining about the product or service. It's more of a neutral observation.\n\nSo the label should be NEUTRAL because the user is neither expressing strong positive nor negative feelings.

The second part is a future action, which doesn't necessarily change the current sentiment.

However, if the user is just stating facts without any emotional charge, it might be neutral. The mention of color not being dark could be a positive or negative depending on expectations. But since there's no explicit positive or negative words here, just observations, it's likely neutral. \n\nI should check for any hidden sentiments.

Finally, \"tavsiye ederim\" is \"I recommend it,\" which is another positive statement.\n\nSo all parts of the sentence are expressing satisfaction and enthusiasm. There's no negative language here. The user is clearly happy with the product or service they're talking about. Even though there's a mention of \"fark görülüyor\" (difference is noticeable), in this context, it's a good thing because it indicates effectiveness or quality.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but the words used are straightforward and positive. No negative words or neutral terms that might indicate indifference. The overall sentiment is definitely positive.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this analysis. The user is talking about using eyeliner continuously and mentions that the tip is very soft but not very useful and it runs. Hmm, so they start by saying they're someone who uses eyeliner a lot, which might be relevant to their experience.\n\nThe key points here are \"ucu çok yumusak\" (the tip is very soft) and \"çok kullanisli değil ve akiyor\" (not very useful and it runs). The user seems to be pointing out that despite the soft tip, the product isn't practical because it runs. \n\nNow, I need to determine the sentiment. The words used are negative: \"kullanisli değil\" (not useful) and \"akiyor\" (runs), which are negative attributes for a product. Even though they mention the tip is soft, which could be positive, the overall context here is about the product's performance being poor. \n\nSo, combining these points, the sentiment leans towards negative.

The phrase translates to \"It doesn't suit the kepe\" or \"It's not good for the kepe.\" Now, \"kepe\" is a Turkish term that refers to a type of traditional clothing, specifically a headscarf worn by women in some regions of Turkey.\n\nThe sentence structure is negative because of the word \"iyi gelmiyor,\" which means \"doesn't suit\" or \"is not good.\" The user is expressing that something (probably a product or item) isn't suitable for the kepe. This could be a critique about the fit, material, or design of an item related to the kepe.\n\nConsidering the sentiment, the use of negative language here indicates dissatisfaction. The person is pointing out a drawback or a problem with the product in relation to the kepe. There's no positive language or neutral observation; it's a clear expression of disapproval. Therefore, the label should be \"NEGATIVE.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this analysis. The user provided a Turkish text that needs to be classified as positive, negative, or neutral. First, I'll read through the text carefully.\n\nThe text starts with \"Abartısız harika bir fiyat\" which translates to \"Unbelievably great price.\" That sounds positive. Then it says \"derime çok yardımcı olmadı amma problem benim derim,\" meaning \"it didn't help my skin much, but the problem is my skin.\" Here, there's a negative aspect about the product not helping the user's skin. However, the next part says \"bu krem bile az da olsa yardım ede bildiyse güçlü bir krem demek tir.\" This translates to \"if this cream could help even a little, it's a strong cream.\" The user is acknowledging that despite the lack of significant improvement, they're giving credit to the product. Finally, \"Teşekkür ederim\" means \"Thank you,\" which is a positive closing.\n\nNow, considering the mixed sentiments: there's a negative part about the product not helping much, but also positive elements like the price being great and the acknowledgment that the cream is strong even if it didn't fully work. The user ends with gratitude. However, the main sentiment here seems to lean more towards neutral because while there are positive aspects (price, acknowledgment of the cream's strength), the primary experience was not helpful for their skin issue. But wait, the user also says that the cream helped a little, which is a positive point. It's a bit tricky. The key might be in the balance between the negative effect on the skin and the positive aspects mentioned. Since the user ends with thanks and acknowledges the product's strength despite the lack of full effectiveness, maybe it's more neutral than negative. But I need to check if the overall sentiment is more negative or not. Alternatively, since they're thanking and giving credit, perhaps it's leaning towards positive. Hmm. Wait, but the main issue was that the cream didn't help much, which is a negative point. However, the user also mentions the price being great and the cream being strong even if it helped a little. It's a mix, but maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because they're not overly negative or positive. The gratitude might tip it slightly towards positive, but I'm not sure. Let me re-read the text again.\n\n\"Abartısız harika bir fiyat\" – very positive about price. \"derime çok yardımcı olmadı amma problem benim derim\" – product didn't help much, but the issue is their skin. Then they say that if it helped even a little, it's a strong cream. So they're giving credit to the product despite not seeing significant results. The last part is thanking. So maybe the overall sentiment is positive because they appreciate the price and acknowledge the product's strength, even though it didn't work as well as they hoped. But there's also a negative aspect about the effectiveness. However, in the context of the user's own skin issues, they might be more lenient. I think the key here is that the user is satisfied with the product despite not achieving their desired results, so maybe it's positive. Alternatively, since the main purpose (helping the skin) wasn't met, it could be negative. But the gratitude and acknowledgment of the cream's strength suggest a neutral or slightly positive sentiment. I'm leaning towards neutral because they're not entirely satisfied but also not completely dissatisfied. The mixed elements make it neutral.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the text \"Fiyati kaliteye gore çok\". I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Fiyati\" means price, \"kaliteye gore\" is \"according to quality\", and \"çok\" means very. So the sentence translates to something like \"The price is very according to quality.\" Wait, that doesn't make complete sense in English. Maybe it's a bit of a broken sentence structure.\n\nBut looking at the context, the user might be saying that the price is very good considering the quality. In Turkish, sometimes people say \"fiyat kaliteye göre çok\" which could imply that the price is appropriate or even low for the quality. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. \n\nIf someone says the price is very according to quality, they might be expressing satisfaction, meaning the price is fair or good for the quality provided. That would lean towards positive. But if the sentence was \"fiyat kaliteye göre çok yüksek\" (the price is too high for the quality), that would be negative. However, in this case, there's no \"yüksek\" (high) word here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant to say \"Fiyatı kaliteye göre çok iyi\" which would clearly be positive. But as it stands, the sentence is incomplete. The word \"çok\" is used without a modifier. So it's unclear whether they're saying the price is very good or very bad in relation to quality.\n\nBut considering common usage, when someone says \"fiyat kaliteye göre çok\", they might be implying that the price is too high compared to the quality. However, I'm not entirely sure. In some contexts, people might use it to say the price is appropriate. \n\nWait, but in Turkish, if you want to express that the price is good for the quality, you'd usually say \"fiyat kaliteye göre uygun\" or \"fiyat kaliteye göre iyi\". Using \"çok\" without a modifier could be confusing. Maybe it's a typo or missing words.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but leaning towards the structure, maybe the user intended to express that the price is too high compared to quality, making it negative. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But since the instruction says to analyze based on the given text, I have to go with what's there.\n\nAlternatively, if \"çok\" is used in a positive sense, like \"the price is very good for the quality\", then it would be positive. But again, without the modifier, it's unclear. \n\nIn such cases, maybe the safest label is neutral because the sentence is incomplete and doesn't clearly express a positive or negative sentiment. However, if forced to choose, considering common usage where \"çok\" might imply excessiveness (like too high), but that's speculative.\n\nWait, looking at the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as neutral. So when someone says \"fiyatına göre okey\", it's a neutral statement. Similarly, if the sentence is incomplete or ambiguous, like here, maybe it should be neutral.\n\nBut in this case, the user wrote \"Fiyati kaliteye gore çok\". The structure is similar to the example but with \"çok\" instead of \"okey\". Since \"çok\" can be positive or negative depending on context, but without a modifier, it's unclear. Therefore, the safest label here would be neutral because the sentiment isn't clearly expressed.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The text is: \"Açıkçası çok beğenmedim ama iş görür elbette daha iyileri mutlaka vardır.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the nuances here. The user starts with \"Açıkçası çok beğenmedim,\" which translates to \"Honestly, I didn't like it much.\" That's a negative sentiment. But then they say \"ama iş görür elbette daha iyileri mutlaka vardır,\" meaning \"but it works, of course there are definitely better ones.\" \n\nSo there's a contrast here. The first part is negative, but the second part is more neutral or even slightly positive because they acknowledge that while it's not great, it functions and there are better options. However, the overall sentiment might lean towards negative because the initial statement is strong. But I need to check if the overall tone is more negative, positive, or neutral.\n\nIn Turkish, when someone says they didn't like something but mentions it works and there are better options, it's often a mixed sentiment. However, since the main sentiment expressed is not liking it (\"çok beğenmedim\"), even though they concede it's functional, the dominant emotion here is negative. The mention of \"daha iyileri\" (better ones) might indicate that the user is looking for something better, which reinforces the negative aspect of the current item.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in such cases, people might use neutral because there's a mix. However, the key part here is \"çok beğenmedim,\" which is a strong negative statement. The rest is more about acknowledging functionality but not being overly positive.

The user is expressing dissatisfaction because the product didn't last long.

The context might be about a product, maybe a hair dryer or something similar. But the key part here is \"hiç beğenmedim\" which is clearly negative.\n\nThe user is expressing dissatisfaction.

The next part is \"asla temizlemiyo.\" \"Asla\" means \"never,\" and \"temizlemiyo\" is the negative form of \"to clean,\" so \"never cleaning.\" Then \"çok kötü\" is \"very bad.\"\n\nPutting it all together: The user is saying that the black spots are never cleaned, and they're very bad. The use of \"asla\" (never) and \"çok kötü\" (very bad) indicates strong negative sentiment. Even though there's a mention of not cleaning, the overall tone is clearly negative because of the emphasis on how bad it is. There's no positive language here, just complaints about the product's quality or service. So the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The text is: \"Olumsuz yorumlarla karşılaştım lakin benim saçlarımı düz ve yumuşacık yaptı.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The person mentions encountering negative reviews (\"Olumsuz yorumlarla karşılaştım\"), which might suggest a negative sentiment. However, they then say that their hair was made straight and soft (\"benim saçlarımı düz ve yumuşacık yaptı\"), which is a positive outcome.\n\nThe key here is the contrast between the negative reviews and the personal positive experience. The word \"lakin\" (but) indicates a contrast. Even though there were negative comments, the user's own experience was positive. \n\nIn sentiment analysis, when there's a mix of negative and positive elements but the overall tone leans towards positive due to the personal satisfaction, it might be classified as POSITIVE. However, if the negative part is more dominant or the context suggests dissatisfaction despite the positive outcome, it could be NEGATIVE or NEUTRAL.\n\nBut in this case, the user's own experience is clearly positive, and the mention of negative reviews might just be background information.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the text: \"Kokusu güzel boyutu çok küçük\". I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Kokusu güzel\" translates to \"The smell is nice\" which is a positive statement. Then \"boyutu çok küçük\" means \"the size is very small\". Now, whether \"small size\" is negative depends on context. If someone expects a larger product and it's smaller than expected, that could be negative. But if the product is meant to be small, like a perfume bottle, maybe it's neutral.\n\nHowever, in many cases, when a product's size is described as very small, especially if it's not specified as intended, it might lead to dissatisfaction. The user might have expected a larger item. So combining both parts: positive about the smell but negative about the size. But how does that balance out?\n\nIn sentiment analysis, mixed sentiments can be tricky. However, the instructions don't mention handling mixed sentiments. The example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is more of a neutral acceptance. Here, the user is pointing out both a positive and a negative aspect. But since there's no clear dominance of one over the other, maybe it's neutral? Or does the presence of both make it negative because the size issue might be a significant drawback?\n\nAlternatively, if the product is something where size isn't critical, like a fragrance, then \"small\" might not be a big deal. But without context, it's hard to say. The instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. Since there are both positive and negative elements, but no clear overall sentiment, maybe the safest is NEUTRAL. However, sometimes in such cases, if one part is strongly positive and the other is a minor issue, it might still be positive. But I think the presence of two opposing sentiments without context would lean towards neutral.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Both of these are negative skin reactions.

First, I need to understand the words used here. \"Kutusu\" means \"the box\" in Turkish. \"Çok\" is \"very\", which is an intensifier. \"Dandik\" translates to \"ugly\" or \"unattractive\". Then there's \"akıyordu\", which comes from the verb \"akmak\", meaning \"to flow\" or \"to run\".\n\nPutting it together: The sentence is saying that the box was very ugly and flowing. Wait, \"flowing\" might be a bit confusing here. Maybe the user meant something like \"the box was very unattractive and moving\"? But \"akıyordu\" could also mean \"was running\" or \"was moving\". However, in context, maybe it's about the box being poorly made or not functioning properly? Or perhaps there's a typo?\n\nWait, \"dandik\" is definitely negative. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the box's appearance. Even if \"akıyordu\" is a bit unclear, the main point here is the use of \"çok dandik\", which is clearly negative. So even if part of the sentence is ambiguous, the overall sentiment leans towards negative because they're criticizing the product's design or quality.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but in Turkish, that's less common unless indicated by context.

Let me correct them for better understanding. Maybe \"dahaca\" should be \"daha da\" and \"saöımı dplgun\" might be \"saçım düğün\". So the corrected text would be: \"Bir saç yağı için gayet normal bir boyda geliyor, daha da iki kez kullanabildim ama saçımı düğün bir hale getirdiğini hissediyorum.\"\n\nNow, breaking it down. The user starts by saying that for a hair oil, the amount is quite normal and they could use it twice. That's positive. But then they mention that they feel their hair has become frizzy. The negative part here is the effect on their hair. \n\nSo there's a mix of positive and negative aspects. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a clear negative outcome despite some positives, the overall sentiment might lean negative. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's effect on their hair, even though they found the quantity acceptable. \n\nBut wait, the instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there are both positive and negative elements, but the negative part seems more impactful here. However, sometimes in such cases, if the negatives outweigh the positives, it's NEGATIVE. Alternatively, if they're balanced, maybe NEUTRAL. But the user is complaining about the hair becoming frizzy, which is a significant negative point. The positive part is just about the quantity. \n\nI think the overall sentiment here is NEGATIVE because the main issue (hair damage) is a strong negative factor. Even though there's a positive note about the amount, the negative experience is more prominent.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Kullanabilir miyim bilmiyorum ama dudakları kızartıp dolgunlaştırıyor.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context and the emotions expressed here. The user mentions that the product \"yaktı\" which translates to \"burned\" or \"damaged\" their lips. That's a negative effect. Then they say they're unsure if they can use it (\"Kullanabilir miyim bilmiyorum\"), indicating doubt or uncertainty, which adds to the negative sentiment.\n\nHowever, there's another part where they mention that the product \"dudakları kızartıp dolgunlaştırıyor\" meaning it makes the lips look fuller. This could be seen as a positive effect. But the overall context seems to be more about the negative experience of burning the lips and uncertainty about continued use. The positive aspect is mentioned but in a way that's overshadowed by the negative consequences.\n\nSo, even though there's a mention of a benefit, the primary sentiment here is negative due to the adverse effects experienced.

The user is expressing dissatisfaction. They expected a purple item but received a black one, which is a color discrepancy. Also, they mention the product is \"aşırı büyük,\" meaning way too big. Both issues are negative aspects.\n\nThe key words here are \"ama\" (but), which introduces a contrast between expectation and reality. The use of \"aşırı büyük\" indicates strong dissatisfaction with the size. Even though there's no explicit negative word like \"kötü\" or \"memnasiyetsiz,\" the context clearly shows frustration.\n\nSo, the sentiment is definitely negative.

But the phrase \"ölü deriyi çıkarmasını beklerdim\" suggests they expected it to remove dead skin, which is good. However, the use of \"ama\" (but) might indicate that the product didn't meet their expectations in some way. The last part \"sağdece😏\" could be a typo for \"sağlamca\" or similar, but with the emoji, it's hard to tell. Maybe they're saying it's just okay? \n\nBut overall, the positive aspects are mentioned first (beautiful product, vitality), and the expectations about exfoliation might not have been fully met, leading to a neutral sentiment.

Then \"yanlış renk\" is \"wrong color\", \"yanlış beden\" is \"wrong size\", and \"geldi\" is \"came\" or \"arrived\". So putting it all together, the user is saying that they received an item (probably a product) that was the wrong color and wrong size. \n\nThe sentiment here seems negative because they're complaining about receiving incorrect items.

There's no positive language here, and the overall tone is complaining about the product's performance and durability.\n\nSo, according to the rules, I should label this as NEGATIVE.

The verb \"idare etmek\" means to manage or handle something. So the person is saying that someone is managing things successfully, which is positive. However, the emoji adds a layer of frustration. Maybe the user is expressing that despite being successful, there's some underlying stress or difficulty.\n\nBut according to the rules, I need to determine the overall sentiment.

The phrase itself doesn't have overtly positive or negative words. However, in some contexts, saying something is \"too small\" could be negative if it's not meeting expectations. But without more context, like whether the user expected a larger size or if there's an implication of dissatisfaction, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, but the original instruction says to use the labels based on the text provided. Since the text just states a fact about the size being small without any emotional language or clear indication of satisfaction or dissatisfaction, the safest label here would be NEUTRAL. The user might be stating an observation without expressing a positive or negative feeling towards it.\n\nSo, I should go with NEUTRAL because there's no explicit sentiment expressed.

First, I need to understand what this means in Turkish. \"Fena\" usually translates to \"bad\" or \"terrible\", but here it's used with a negative suffix. The phrase \"değil\" means \"not\", so \"fena değil\" would be \"not bad\" or \"okay\". However, the user wrote \"fena değildii\" with two 'i's at the end. That might be a typo, but even so, the intended meaning is likely \"it wasn't bad\".\n\nIn Turkish, when someone says something like \"fena değil\", they're expressing that something is acceptable or not bad. This is often used in contexts where the speaker is giving a neutral to slightly positive opinion. For example, if someone asks about a product and you say \"fena değil\", you're saying it's okay but not necessarily great.\n\nLooking at the rules provided, the labels are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since the user is indicating that something wasn't bad, this leans towards a neutral sentiment. There's no strong positive language here like \"harika\" (wonderful) or \"iyi\" (good), but also no strong negative words. The use of \"değil\" negates the negative term \"fena\", leading to a neutral stance.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but without additional context, it's safe to assume the literal interpretation.

The user is probably talking about how well the product hydrates the skin.\n\nThe emoji 👍 is a thumbs-up, which is another positive indicator.

However, in Turkish, when someone says \"ürünleri emiyor,\" it's often used metaphorically to mean that the product isn't effective or isn't working as intended. For example, if a product is supposed to absorb something but isn't, this phrase would be used.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The user is pointing out a negative aspect of the product—its ineffectiveness.

Then \"genisligi dar\" translates to \"narrow width,\" another negative point. The phrase \"bekledigim gibi cikmadi\" means \"didn't come out as expected.\" All these parts are expressing disappointment or dissatisfaction.\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"çok kisa\" (very short), \"dar\" (narrow), and \"cikmadi\" (did not come out).

First, I need to understand what this means in Turkish. \"Etkisi\" translates to \"effect\" or \"impact,\" and \"hiç yok\" means \"none at all.\" So the whole phrase is saying \"there's no effect at all.\"\n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The user is stating that there's no effect, which could be negative if they were expecting an effect. For example, if someone took a medication and says it has no effect, that's negative. But without context, it's tricky. However, in many cases, saying something has \"hiç yok\" (none) is usually negative because it indicates disappointment or lack of success.\n\nLooking at the rules again: the labels are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. Since the user didn't provide any positive words, and \"hiç yok\" is a strong negation, this is likely NEGATIVE. But wait, could it be neutral? If the context is something where no effect is expected, but here there's no context given. The default would be to assume that if someone says there's no effect, they're dissatisfied. So NEGATIVE makes sense here.\n\nI should check examples again. The example for NEGATIVE was \"Zehirlendim.\" which is \"I got poisoned,\" clearly negative. Another example: \"Fiyatına göre okey\" is neutral. So in this case, \"etkisi hiç yok\" is expressing a lack of effect, which is negative. Therefore, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Translating it directly, it says \"Not a permanent smell.\" Now, considering the context, someone might be talking about a product, maybe a fragrance or something that has an odor.\n\nThe key here is the word \"kalıcı,\" which means permanent or lasting. The phrase \"değil\" negates it, so the sentence is saying that the smell isn't permanent. If someone is commenting on a product's scent and says it's not permanent, that could be positive if they're implying it's temporary and maybe less overwhelming. But without more context, it's tricky.\n\nHowever, in sentiment analysis, we often look at the overall tone. The sentence itself doesn't have overtly negative or positive words. It's stating a fact about the smell being non-permanent. So, the sentiment might be neutral because there's no clear positive or negative emotion expressed. The user isn't explicitly happy or upset; they're just making an observation.\n\nI should check if \"kalıcı bir koku\" has any connotations. In some contexts, a permanent smell could be negative (like bad odor), so saying it's not permanent might be positive. But without knowing the context of the product, it's safer to assume neutrality. The sentence doesn't express satisfaction or dissatisfaction explicitly.\n\nTherefore, the label should be NEUTRAL because there's no clear indication of positive or negative sentiment.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

All these are positive attributes. There's no negative language here. Even \"anında emiliyor\" doesn't have a negative connotation in this context.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a Turkish text that needs sentiment analysis. The text is: \"Yorumlardan bakarak S almam gerek diye dusunup S soyledim ama aşırı küçük çok kötü EDİT:L aldım rahat oldu\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person initially thought they should get an 'S' based on reviews, but then says \"aşırı küçük çok kötü\" which translates to \"too small, very bad\". Then there's an edit where they mention getting an 'L' and feeling relieved.\n\nBreaking it down: The initial part has negative words like \"çok kötü\" (very bad). However, after the edit, they say they got an 'L' and \"rahat oldu\" (felt better). So there's a shift from negative to positive. But the main sentiment here is about the product size. They were unhappy with the 'S' but satisfied with the 'L'. \n\nThe key is whether the overall sentiment is more positive, negative, or neutral. The user had a bad experience with the 'S' but then found relief with the 'L'. However, the primary complaint was about the size being too small and bad, which is negative. But the resolution (getting an 'L') made them feel better. \n\nBut in sentiment analysis, we usually look at the overall tone. Even though there's a positive ending, the main issue was the initial problem with the product. However, since they resolved it by getting a larger size and felt relieved, maybe it's neutral? Or does the negative part outweigh the positive?\n\nWait, the user is talking about their own experience. They first thought to get an 'S' but then realized it was too small and bad, so they changed to an 'L' and were happy. The main sentiment here is that they had a problem (negative) but resolved it (positive). However, the overall sentiment might be neutral because the negative part was addressed. But sometimes, even if there's a resolution, the initial negative experience can make the overall sentiment negative. \n\nAlternatively, since they ended up being satisfied after changing sizes, maybe it's positive? Hmm. But the original complaint was about the 'S' being too small and bad. The fact that they had to change to an 'L' might indicate dissatisfaction with the product's sizing, leading to a negative sentiment. However, the relief at the end could be seen as positive. \n\nBut in many cases, when someone has a problem but resolves it, the overall sentiment is neutral because the issue was fixed. But I need to check if the resolution is part of the same experience. Since they had to change sizes, maybe the product's sizing was an issue, leading to a negative sentiment. However, the relief might be positive. \n\nI think in this case, the dominant sentiment is negative because the initial problem (product being too small and bad) is more impactful than the resolution. Even though they felt better after changing, the main experience was negative. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's neutral because the issue was resolved. \n\nAlternatively, since the user ended up happy with the 'L', maybe the overall sentiment is positive. But that might be stretching it. The key part is \"aşırı küçük çok kötü\" which is clearly negative. Then they changed and felt better. So the main sentiment is a mix, but the initial strong negative statement might make the overall label negative. However, the resolution could tip it to neutral. \n\nI think in this case, the correct label would be NEGATIVE because the user had a bad experience with the product size initially, even though they resolved it by changing sizes. The negative part is more prominent here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, looking at the words used. \"Çok\" means \"very,\" which is an intensifier. \"Kalın\" translates to \"thick.\" The phrase \"bir ucu var\" means \"there is an end\" or \"it has an end.\" So putting it all together: \"There is a very thick end.\" \n\nNow, the context isn't clear. Is this referring to something physical, like an object with a thick end? Or maybe a metaphorical use? Without more context, it's hard to tell. The words themselves are neutral in terms of sentiment. \"Kalın\" can be positive or negative depending on the situation. For example, if someone is talking about a pen having a thick tip, that might be positive for writing, but if it's about a medical condition, it could be negative. However, the sentence doesn't provide enough context to determine the sentiment.\n\nThe user also mentioned that the response should be in JSON with only the label.

So the sentence is saying that the closing effect is normal. \n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The word \"normal\" here isn't inherently positive or negative. It's a neutral descriptor. There's no explicit positive words like \"harika\" (great) or negative words like \"zehirli\" (poisonous). The user might be stating a fact without expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction. \n\nBut wait, could there be any hidden sentiment? If someone expects the closing effect to be better than normal and it's just normal, maybe that's slightly negative. However, without context, we can't assume that. The sentence is straightforward, stating a fact. \n\nAccording to the rules, if the text doesn't clearly express positive or negative emotions, it should be neutral.

The use of \"üstelik\" (moreover) adds to the negative sentiment by emphasizing another issue.\n\nThe emoji 👎 at the end is a thumbs down, which is a clear indicator of dissatisfaction. \n\nPutting this all together, the user is expressing strong dissatisfaction with the product's color and fit, both not meeting their expectations. The language used is negative, with explicit complaints and a disapproving emoji. There's no positive or neutral language here.

The user wrote, \"Kokusu fena değil 1 kez kullandım orta halli gözüküyor.\" Translating that to English: \"The smell isn't bad, I used it once and it looks okay.\" \n\nFirst, looking at the keywords. \"Fena değil\" means \"not bad,\" which is a positive remark. Then, \"orta halli\" translates to \"okay\" or \"average,\" which is neutral. The user mentions using it once, which might indicate limited experience, but the overall sentiment seems to be leaning towards positive because they're not complaining about the smell and are saying it's okay.\n\nBut wait, \"orta halli\" could also imply that it's just average, not exceptional.

However, \"fena değil\" is a positive statement. Maybe the label should be POSITIVE. But I need to check if the overall tone is more positive or neutral. Since the user didn't express any dissatisfaction and mentioned a positive aspect (smell not bad) and a neutral one (okay), maybe it's leaning towards positive. Alternatively, since \"orta halli\" is neutral, the overall could be neutral. This is a bit tricky.

But could it have a different connotation?\n\nWait, sometimes phrases can be idiomatic. Let me think. If someone says \"yapış yapış,\" are they talking about something physically sticky, like glue, or is it metaphorical? For example, if someone is being overly attached in a relationship, maybe they'd use this term. But without context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the rules again: I have to classify it as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.

First, I need to understand what this means in Turkish. \"Sacim\" refers to a type of fabric or material, and \"kurutmak\" means to dry out. So the sentence translates to something like \"It dried out my sacim.\" \n\nNow, considering the context, if someone is saying that their fabric was dried out, it's likely a negative experience because drying out might mean damage or loss of quality. The word \"çok\" (very) intensifies the feeling, indicating a strong negative effect.\n\nLooking at the possible labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. Since the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product causing their fabric to dry out, this should be labeled as NEGATIVE. There's no ambiguity here; it's clearly a complaint about damage caused by the product.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Then they say \"almayın\" which is \"don't buy\", reinforcing the negative sentiment. The comparison to a previous product (\"önceki kullandığım faber castell seti gibi değildi\") suggests dissatisfaction, as they're saying it's not like the one they used before, implying it's worse or different in a bad way. The thumbs down emoji 👎 also adds to the negativity.\n\nSo all the elements here point towards a negative sentiment.

The user wrote, \"çok kullanmadım ama pekde faydasını goremedim.\" Translating that to English, it's something like, \"I didn't use it much, but I couldn't see the benefits.\" \n\nFirst, looking at the keywords: \"çok kullanmadım\" means they didn't use it a lot. Then \"pekde faydasını goremedim\" translates to \"couldn't see the benefits.\" The word \"pekde\" here is a bit tricky. It can mean \"very\" or \"much,\" but in this context, it's used to emphasize that the benefit wasn't noticeable.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The user isn't outright negative; they're stating a lack of perceived benefit. However, since they didn't use it much, maybe there's a neutral stance here. But wait, even though they didn't use it, the fact that they couldn't see the benefits might lean towards negative. But I need to check if the overall sentiment is more negative or neutral.\n\nIn some cases, people might say they didn't use something but still have a neutral opinion. However, the phrase \"pekde faydasını goremedim\" suggests dissatisfaction. The user is pointing out that even though they tried it (a little), there was no benefit. That could be seen as negative because they're highlighting the absence of positive outcomes.\n\nBut on the other hand, if someone hasn't used a product much, their opinion might not be strong enough to be labeled negative. However, in this case, the user is making a statement about the lack of benefits, which implies a negative experience. \n\nWait, but maybe \"pekde\" here is used in a way that's more like \"not really\" or \"hardly.\" So \"couldn't see the benefits\" might be more neutral because they're just stating their observation without strong emotion. However, the combination with \"çok kullanmadım\" (didn't use much) could mean that even with limited use, there was no benefit, which might lean towards negative.\n\nAlternatively, if someone didn't use it much and couldn't see benefits, maybe they are neutral because they don't have enough experience. But the act of mentioning not seeing benefits could be a mild negative. \n\nHmm, I think in this case, since the user is pointing out that there was no benefit despite some usage, even if minimal, it's more likely to be negative. However, sometimes \"neither positive nor negative\" can apply if the sentiment isn't clear. But given the context here, the mention of not seeing benefits might be a negative point.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Then there's \"Ama şarj etme girişinin kapağı yok yıkarken dikkat etmek gerekiyor.\" The word \"ama\" means \"but,\" indicating a contrast. The user is pointing out that the charging port cover is missing, so they have to be careful when cleaning. This part sounds negative because it's mentioning a flaw or inconvenience.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The review has both positive and negative elements. However, in sentiment analysis, if there are mixed sentiments, we often look at which part is more dominant. Here, the positive comment is about the main function (cleaning), while the negative is about a design flaw. But since the user mentions the negative aspect as a drawback that requires caution, it might tip the balance towards negative. However, sometimes neutral is used if both sides are equally present. Wait, but the example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey,\" which is more of an indifferent statement. Here, the user is expressing both satisfaction and a problem. But in some cases, mixed sentiments can be labeled as neutral. However, I need to check the rules again. The user instructions say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. If there's a clear positive and negative part, but no clear dominance, maybe it's neutral? Or does the presence of both make it neutral?\n\nWait, looking at the examples: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral because it's indifferent. In this case, the user has a positive point (cleans well) and a negative (missing cover). But since they are two separate points, maybe the overall sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative. However, sometimes in such cases, if the negative is a drawback but the main function is good, it might still be positive. Alternatively, if the negative part is significant enough to affect the overall experience, it could be negative. But I think in this case, since both are present and neither is overwhelmingly dominant, the label would be NEUTRAL. Wait, but the example given for neutral was a statement that's not clearly positive or negative. Here, there's a mix. However, according to standard sentiment analysis practices, mixed sentiments can sometimes be labeled as neutral if they balance each other out. But I need to make sure. Let me think again: The user is happy with the cleaning performance but has a complaint about the design. So it's both positive and negative. But since the instructions don't mention handling mixed sentiments, maybe in such cases, we should go with the dominant sentiment. However, if they are equally present, then neutral. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both makes it neutral. The example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey,\" which is a balanced statement. So here, since there's both positive and negative aspects, maybe NEUTRAL is appropriate.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

If the detergent isn't foaming, it might not clean effectively. The tone here seems negative because they're pointing out a problem with the product's performance.

The user mentions that the delivery was very fast, which is a positive point. They also say that the order arrived the next day, which reinforces the positive aspect of quick shipping.\n\nHowever, the second part talks about the color being too dark, even though they expected the lightest shade. That's a negative point regarding the product's quality or accuracy. The user seems satisfied with the delivery speed but disappointed with the product's color. \n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. Since there are both positive and negative elements, but the main focus here is on the product's color issue, which might be more impactful for the user experience. However, the instructions say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. If the review has mixed sentiments, but one part is more dominant, how do I decide?\n\nWait, the example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which translates to \"Okay considering the price,\" indicating a neutral stance. In this case, the user has both positive and negative points. But maybe the overall sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative. However, the examples don't have mixed cases. The rules might require choosing the dominant emotion. \n\nThe delivery speed is positive, but the product color issue is negative. Since the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's quality despite the fast delivery, the negative aspect might be more significant. But I need to check if the overall sentiment leans more towards one. Alternatively, maybe it's neutral because there are both positives and negatives. However, in the examples, a mixed review isn't shown. The instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. If the majority of the sentiment is negative, then label as NEGATIVE. But here, it's split. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is more focused on the product issue, which is a negative point. Even though delivery was good, the main complaint is about the product color. So perhaps the overall sentiment is NEGATIVE. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: if the positive and negative aspects are separate (delivery vs. product), maybe it's neutral because they're different aspects. However, the user might be more concerned with the product quality. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. The examples don't cover mixed sentiments. Maybe in such cases, we should look for the dominant sentiment. If the user starts with positive but ends with a negative, which is stronger? The color issue seems to be the main complaint here. So maybe NEGATIVE. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, if both are equally weighted, it's NEUTRAL. However, the instruction might expect that if there's a clear negative aspect despite some positives, it's labeled as NEGATIVE. \n\nI think in this case, the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product (color) even though delivery was good. So the overall sentiment would be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

They mention that the texture is nice (\"dokusu güzel\"), but the color is misleading (\"renk aldatıcı\").\n\nNow, breaking down the sentiment. The initial expectation vs. reality: they were expecting one color but got another. That's a negative point because it's unexpected and possibly disappointing. However, they do compliment the texture, which is positive. But then they say the color is deceptive, which adds to the negative aspect.\n\nSo there are both positive and negative elements here. The key is whether the overall sentiment leans more towards one. The user seems satisfied with the texture but disappointed with the color discrepancy. Since the main point of the review might be about the product not meeting expectations in terms of color, even though the texture is good, the overall sentiment could be neutral or slightly negative.\n\nBut looking at the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL.

The words \"Beyazlarim\" probably refer to white items or something related to whites, maybe laundry? \"Az olmasina ragmen\" translates to \"despite being few\" or \"although they were few.\" \"Kapatmadi\" means \"did not close\" or \"didn't shut.\"\n\nPutting it together: \"Despite my whites being few, they didn't close.\" Hmm, that's a bit unclear. Maybe the context is about laundry? Like, even though there weren't many white clothes, the machine didn't close? Or maybe it's about something else, like doors or windows?\n\nWait, \"Beyazlarim\" could be a name or a term specific to a certain context. If it's a person's name, then the sentence might be saying that despite their few whites (maybe a nickname?), they didn't close something. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nLooking at the sentiment. The user wants POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The sentence seems neutral in terms of emotion. There's no clear positive or negative words here. It's stating a fact: despite something being few, an action wasn't taken. No obvious joy or sadness. So probably NEUTRAL.\n\nBut wait, maybe \"kapatmadi\" has a negative connotation? If the expectation was for them to close, but they didn't, that could be negative. However, without knowing the context of why closing is important, it's hard to assign a sentiment. The user might just be reporting an event without expressing approval or disapproval.\n\nSo safest bet is NEUTRAL because there's no clear emotional language here.

The phrase is clearly positive because \"güzel\" is a positive adjective, and \"gayet\" intensifies it. There's no negative language here. Even if someone might think it's neutral because it's not extremely enthusiastic, in Turkish sentiment analysis, \"gayet güzel\" is typically categorized as positive.

There's no explicit positive or negative language here. They're just stating an intention to share their feedback again.

The user wrote, \"Güzel fakat fırçaları zaman geçtikçe kuruyor.\" Translating that to English, it's \"Good but the brushes dry out over time.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The sentence starts with \"Güzel,\" which means \"good\" or \"nice,\" so that's a positive aspect. However, the second part mentions that the brushes dry out as time passes. That sounds like a negative point because it's pointing out a flaw or a problem with the product.\n\nNow, I have to determine whether the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The user is giving both a positive and a negative comment. But in sentiment analysis, when there are mixed sentiments, we often look at which part is more dominant. However, the instructions here don't specify handling mixed sentiments. The example given for \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL because it's a balanced statement.\n\nIn this case, the user starts with a positive remark but then points out a negative aspect. Since both parts are present and neither is clearly more dominant than the other, the overall sentiment might be neutral. However, sometimes the presence of a negative comment can tip the balance towards negative, especially if the product's functionality is being criticized. But since the user still mentions it's \"good,\" maybe they're giving a mixed review but not strongly negative.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules: the labels are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The examples include cases where there's a clear positive or negative sentiment. For mixed sentiments, like in the example given by the user, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. So maybe here, even though there's a positive and a negative part, since they are both present, it's considered neutral.\n\nBut I need to be careful. The first part is positive, but the second part is a complaint. However, in some contexts, if the product has a major flaw, even if there's a positive aspect, the overall sentiment could be negative. But without more context, like how significant the drying out issue is, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is just pointing out that while the product is good, there's an issue with the brushes. So they're not entirely satisfied but still see some positives. In such cases, the sentiment might be neutral because it's a balanced view without strong positive or negative emotions dominating.\n\nSo based on the examples provided, if there's a mix of positive and negative elements without clear dominance, NEUTRAL is appropriate.

That seems negative because it's about something not performing as expected. But then there's an emoji 😂 which is a laughing face. That could indicate sarcasm or humor. Maybe the person is saying that something didn't shine, but they're laughing at it, so maybe it's a positive or neutral reaction.\n\nWait, in Turkish, \"parlamadı\" can be used in contexts like a product not working as intended, but with the emoji, it might be more lighthearted. However, without more context, it's tricky. The absence of a positive word and the presence of a negative verb might lean towards negative, but the emoji complicates things. Maybe the user is using sarcasm, implying that even though it didn't shine, they're amused. But in many cases, if someone says something didn't work and adds a laugh, it could be neutral or even positive depending on intent. However, since there's no clear positive indicator, maybe it's still negative. Alternatively, the emoji might soften the negative statement into neutral. I need to check examples again. The example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is more of a neutral acceptance. Here, the user didn't say anything about price but used an emoji. Maybe the lack of clear positive or negative words makes it neutral? But \"parlamadı\" itself is negative. Hmm. I think in this case, the primary sentiment is negative, but the emoji might make it more neutral. However, since the main verb is negative and the emoji is just an expression, maybe it's still negative. Or perhaps the user is being sarcastic, so the actual sentiment is positive.

Then they say \"geri iade ettim,\" which means \"I returned it.\" Returning something usually indicates dissatisfaction, so that reinforces the negative sentiment. \n\nNext, \"bir beden kücük alınmalı\" – \"a small body should be taken.\" Wait, maybe there's a typo here? Maybe \"beden\" is supposed to be \"beden\" (body) but in context, perhaps it's referring to a product size? Like \"small size should be taken.\" But even so, the user is talking about returning something because they didn't like it, and mentioning a small size might be a neutral comment, but the overall action of returning the item is negative.\n\nSo combining all parts: the user didn't like the product enough to return it, which is clearly negative. The mention of the size might be a neutral observation, but the main sentiment here is negative due to the dissatisfaction leading to a return. So the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Translating that to English, it says something like, \"It doesn't work at all, the brush is nice but it's everywhere in ten TL anyway.\" \n\nFirst, looking at the sentiment. The user starts with a strong negative statement: \"Hiç bir işe yaramıyor\" which means \"It doesn't work at all.\" That's clearly negative. Then they mention \"fırca güzel\" meaning \"the brush is nice,\" which is positive. But then they say \"her yerde on tlye bulunuyor zaten\" translating to \"it's everywhere in ten TL anyway.\" The use of \"zaten\" (anyway) suggests that the price is not a big issue, but the main problem is that it doesn't work.\n\nSo even though there's a positive comment about the brush, the overall sentiment is dominated by the negative aspect of the product not working. The mention of price being low might be a neutral point, but since the user is complaining about functionality, the primary emotion here is frustration or dissatisfaction. Therefore, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this analysis. The user provided a Turkish text that needs to be categorized as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The text is: \"Fiyat performans açısından fena değil. Ama lekeli ciltler için ne kadar sık kullansanızda yeterli olmuyor.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break it down into parts. The first part says \"Fiyat performans açısından fena değil,\" which translates to \"In terms of price performance, it's not bad.\" That sounds positive because they're saying it's acceptable or decent in that aspect.\n\nThen there's the second part: \"Ama lekeli ciltler için ne kadar sık kullansanızda yeterli olmuyor.\" Translating to \"But for acne-prone skin, no matter how often you use it, it's not sufficient.\" This is a negative point because they're pointing out a drawback, especially for people with acne-prone skin.\n\nNow, the challenge is determining the overall sentiment. The first part is positive, but the second part is negative. However, in such cases where there's both positive and negative feedback, the dominant sentiment might depend on context. But since the user hasn't specified any weighting, I need to consider if it's a mix or if one part outweighs the other.\n\nIn many sentiment analysis scenarios, mixed sentiments can be neutral if they balance each other out. However, sometimes the presence of both positive and negative aspects might lead to a more nuanced label. But according to the rules given, the options are only POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. \n\nLooking at the example provided in the instructions: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. That's a case where the user is saying it's okay for the price, which is neutral. Similarly, here, the text has both positive and negative aspects but doesn't strongly lean towards one. The first part is positive about price-performance, but the second part is negative regarding effectiveness for acne-prone skin. Since there are two opposing sentiments without a clear dominant one, it might be considered NEUTRAL.\n\nAlternatively, if the negative aspect is more critical (like effectiveness), it could tip the scale to NEGATIVE. But the first part is about price-performance, which is a different aspect. The user might be saying that while the product isn't bad in terms of cost-effectiveness, it's not effective for certain skin types. That could mean the overall sentiment is mixed but leaning towards negative because the effectiveness is a major factor for the product's purpose.\n\nHowever, without explicit instructions on how to handle such cases, and given the examples provided where a mix can be neutral (like \"Fiyatına göre okey\"), I think the safest bet here is NEUTRAL. The user is pointing out both pros and cons without strongly favoring one over the other.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user wrote, \"Rengi biraz açık ama güzel tavsiye ederim.\" Translating that to English, it's something like, \"The color is a bit light but beautiful, I recommend it.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The sentence has two parts connected by \"ama,\" which means \"but\" in Turkish. The first part says the color is a bit light (\"biraz açık\"), which could be seen as a negative point. However, the second part uses \"güzel\" (beautiful) and \"tavsiye ederim\" (I recommend it), which are positive statements.\n\nSo even though there's a minor criticism about the color being too light, the overall sentiment is positive because the user still recommends the product. The negative aspect is downplayed by the positive recommendation. In such cases, the dominant emotion tends to be positive unless the negative part is strong enough to override it. Here, the positive elements seem stronger.\n\nI should check if there's any ambiguity. The word \"biraz\" (a bit) might indicate a mild complaint, but combined with the recommendation, it's more of a minor issue. Therefore, the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The key points are \"kısa zamanda\" (quickly), \"kolay\" (easy), \"istediğim gibi\" (as expected), and \"teşekkürler\" (thank you). All these phrases are positive. The user is happy with the delivery speed, ease of use, and that the product met their expectations. There's no negative language here.

The first part already sets a negative tone, and the second part adds to that by indicating that someone caused an issue. There's no positive language here, just complaints.

The user provided a Turkish text, and I need to determine the sentiment label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The user mentions that they ordered the product because it was pumpable, but upon receiving it, it didn't come with a pump as others had noted in their reviews. However, they state that since it's a cream they've always used, they won't return it.\n\nNow, breaking down the sentiment. The initial part is negative because the product didn't meet expectations (didn't have a pump). But then the user mentions they won't return it because it's a familiar product. This shows some level of satisfaction despite the issue. However, the main point here is that the product didn't arrive as described, which is a negative aspect. The fact that they're not returning it might be due to habit rather than satisfaction with the current product. \n\nBut wait, the user isn't expressing happiness or positive feelings about the product's performance. They're just stating they won't return it because of prior use. So the sentiment here leans more towards negative because the product didn't meet their expectations (no pump), even though they're not returning it. However, there's no explicit positive statement either. \n\nAlternatively, maybe NEUTRAL? Because they're not overly negative or positive. They had an issue but are not returning the product. But the initial problem is a negative point. The key here is whether the overall sentiment is more negative or neutral. Since the user is pointing out a problem (product didn't arrive as described) and even though they're not returning it, the main experience was negative. \n\nBut in some cases, if the user is satisfied with the product despite the issue, it might be neutral. However, the text doesn't indicate satisfaction with the product's performance. They just mention that they've used it before and won't return it. So the sentiment is more about the inconvenience of not getting the pump but not a strong positive or negative feeling overall. \n\nHmm, maybe NEUTRAL? Because there's a mix: dissatisfaction with the product's arrival (negative) but no strong negative emotions expressed beyond that. The user isn't happy but also not extremely upset. They're just stating facts and their decision not to return it. So perhaps NEUTRAL is the right label here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

That's clearly positive.\n\nBut then the second part: \"Kalıcı değil\" translates to \"Not permanent.\" This could be negative because it's saying the effect isn't lasting. However, the user might be referring to the fragrance not being long-lasting, which is a common concern for perfumes or scented products. \n\nNow, considering the overall sentiment. The first part is very positive, but the second part introduces a negative aspect. But in some contexts, if someone says something is amazing but not permanent, they might still be satisfied with it, especially if they're okay with the scent not lasting long. Alternatively, it could be neutral because the user is acknowledging both the positive and negative aspects without strong feelings overall.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The key here is whether the dominant sentiment is positive, negative, or if it's a mix leading to neutral. Since the first part is strongly positive and the second part is a minor negative, maybe the overall sentiment is still positive. However, sometimes in such cases, people might consider it neutral because there's a contradiction.

The user is talking about a product's effect on hair, specifically mentioning that if you want your hair to open (maybe referring to styling or drying), you should leave it on for 15-20 minutes after applying. They also say \"çok güzel aciliyor\" which translates to \"it's very good at accelerating\" or \"it works quickly\".\n\nNow, looking for sentiment indicators. Words like \"çok güzel\" (very good) are positive. The overall context seems to be a recommendation or instruction on how to use a product effectively. There's no negative language here. The user is providing advice, not expressing dissatisfaction.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any hidden negative connotation. The phrase \"aciliyor\" might mean the product works quickly, which is positive. The structure of the sentence is more informational than emotional. So the sentiment is likely neutral because it's giving instructions rather than expressing a personal feeling.\n\nWait, but \"çok güzel\" is clearly positive. Maybe the user is sharing a positive experience. But the main content is about usage steps, not an explicit opinion. Hmm. The instruction part is neutral, but the use of \"çok güzel\" adds a positive note. However, since the majority of the text is procedural, maybe it's still neutral. Or does the presence of a positive adjective make it positive?\n\nIn some cases, even if there's a positive word, if the overall context is neutral (like instructions), the label might be neutral. But sometimes, the presence of any positive term can tip it to positive. Need to decide based on the example given. For instance, in the sample input \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is neutral, even though \"okey\" is somewhat positive, the context is about price, so neutral.\n\nSimilarly here, the user is giving advice, not expressing a personal sentiment.

First, I need to understand what this means in Turkish. \"Kötü\" translates to \"bad\" or \"poor,\" which is clearly a negative term. Then there's \"sertleşmek,\" which means \"to harden\" or \"to become firm.\" The suffix \"-iyor\" indicates an ongoing action. So the sentence is saying something like \"It's hardening badly\" or \"It's becoming too firm in a bad way.\"\n\nNow, considering the sentiment analysis rules provided. The user wants only POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL labels. Since \"kötü\" is a strong negative word, this should be labeled as NEGATIVE. Even though there's a verb about hardening, the presence of \"kötü\" makes the overall sentiment clearly negative. There's no ambiguity here. The example given in the instructions where \"Zehirlendim.\" (I got poisoned) was labeled NEGATIVE, so similar logic applies here. No need to consider neutral because there's a clear negative adjective used.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The mention of exercise (\"sporla\") might be a mitigating factor, but it doesn't negate the initial discomfort. \n\nI need to decide if the overall sentiment leans more towards negative or neutral. Since the user is reporting an adverse reaction (burning), that's a clear negative point. However, they're not entirely dismissive of the product, just cautious.

However, there are negative aspects mentioned later: the product arrived in a bag with different color and brand, and \"hiç iyi değildi\" which translates to \"was not good at all.\" \n\nThe challenge here is balancing the positive and negative parts.

However, the presence of \"hiç iyi değildi\" is quite strong. Let me check again. The user mentions being satisfied with the heating but then points out issues with the product's appearance and brand, ending with a strong negative. This seems like a mix, but the final judgment is likely negative because the overall experience was not good despite some positives. \n\nAlternatively, if the positive and negative aspects are equally weighted, it might be neutral.

The use of \"ama\" (but) might indicate a contrast between the current situation and their action.\n\nThe first part, \"Henüz bir sonuç alamadım,\" suggests some level of dissatisfaction or frustration because they haven't seen any results. However, the second part shows proactive behavior by ordering another product. This could imply that they're still hopeful or trying to find a solution, which might be neutral or even positive.\n\nBut wait, the fact that they haven't received results yet is negative, but the action of ordering again might not necessarily be positive.

They mention not seeing much effect on plumping, which is a negative point. However, they also note that it adds color, which is a positive aspect.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The user has both positive and negative elements. But in sentiment analysis, if there's a mix, we have to see which part dominates. The first part is negative (\"couldn't see much effect\"), but the second part is positive (\"adds color\"). However, the use of \"ama\" (but) might indicate that the positive aspect is a counterpoint to the negative. \n\nBut in many cases, when there's a mix, if one part is strongly negative and the other is neutral or slightly positive, the overall sentiment might lean towards negative. Alternatively, if both are balanced, it could be neutral. However, the user didn't express strong dissatisfaction; they just mentioned a lack of effect but acknowledged a benefit.\n\nLooking at the example given in the instructions: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" translates to \"It's okay for the price,\" which is neutral.

But I need to check if the examples provided by the user can guide me.\n\nIn the example given, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. Here, the user has two points: one negative and one positive. If the sentiment is balanced, then neutral would be appropriate. However, sometimes the presence of both could lead to a more nuanced analysis.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a Turkish text that needs to be analyzed for sentiment. The text is: \"bayildim tuba burak hikayesinde gördüm bundan sonraki kokumm bu olcak fiyat bayağı uygun\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context and the words used here. The user starts with \"bayildim\", which means \"I fainted\" or \"I was shocked\" in Turkish. That's a strong negative reaction. Then they mention \"tuba burak hikayesinde gördüm\" – so they saw Tuba Burak's story. Tuba Burak is a Turkish actress, and maybe the user is referring to something she did or said that caused a reaction.\n\nNext part: \"bundan sonraki kokumm bu olcak\" translates to \"from now on my smell will be like this\". That seems odd. Maybe they're talking about a product, like perfume or something related to scent? But the connection isn't clear yet.\n\nThen \"fiyat bayağı uygun\" means \"the price is very reasonable\". So there's a positive note here about the price being good. \n\nPutting it all together: The user was shocked by Tuba Burak's story, which might have been something related to a product (maybe perfume or fragrance), and now they're saying that from now on their smell will be like that, but the price is very reasonable. \n\nThe sentiment here seems mixed. The initial reaction is negative (\"bayildim\"), but then there's a positive comment about the price. However, in Turkish, \"bayağı uygun\" can sometimes have a sarcastic tone depending on context. But without more context, it's safer to go with the direct meaning. \n\nBut wait, the user might be referring to a product that Tuba Burak used, and they're saying that after seeing her story, they decided to use that product (hence \"kokumm bu olcak\" – my smell will be like this), and the price is good. So the overall sentiment could be positive because despite being shocked, they found the price reasonable and are planning to use it. However, the initial shock might lean towards negative. \n\nBut in sentiment analysis, we usually look at the dominant emotion. The user mentions a negative reaction but then follows up with a positive statement about the price. It's possible that the overall sentiment is neutral because there's both positive and negative elements. But I need to check if \"bayildim\" is strong enough to tip it towards negative. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the shock was due to something surprising but positive. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. In such cases, the safest bet might be to consider the presence of both positive and negative elements leading to neutral. But I should also check if \"bayağı uygun\" is a strong enough positive to override the initial shock. \n\nIn Turkish, \"bayağı uygun\" can sometimes be used sarcastically, but in this case, it's more likely genuine since they're talking about the price being reasonable. So maybe the overall sentiment is positive because despite the initial shock, the user is happy with the price and plans to use the product. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: \"bayildim\" could be a strong negative reaction, but if it's due to something surprising that led them to find a good deal, maybe it's mixed. However, in sentiment analysis, we often categorize based on the overall tone. If there's a clear positive and negative, sometimes it's neutral. But if one is stronger, it might lean towards that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"bayildim\" here is used more as an expression of surprise rather than a strong negative. In Turkish, \"bayılmak\" can mean to faint, but in colloquial use, it can also mean being shocked or amazed. So if they were shocked by Tuba Burak's story and then found the price good, maybe the overall sentiment is positive. \n\nBut I'm still torn between neutral and positive. However, since there's a clear positive statement about the price being very reasonable, which might be the main point, I think the label should be POSITIVE. But I need to make sure that \"bayildim\" isn't overriding that. \n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. So if there's a mix of emotions, it might be neutral. However, here the user is expressing both shock and satisfaction with the price. It's possible that the overall sentiment is positive because they are happy with the price despite being shocked by something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the shock was negative, but the price being good makes it neutral. But I think in this case, since the user ends on a positive note about the price, and the initial shock might be more of an exclamation rather than a strong negative sentiment, the label could be POSITIVE. However, without more context, it's challenging. \n\nAnother approach: Check if \"bayildim\" is used here as a strong negative. If so, then the sentiment would be negative. But if it's just expressing surprise, maybe not. In Turkish, \"bayılmak\" can mean to faint, but in some contexts, people use it to express being shocked or amazed. So if they were shocked by Tuba Burak's story and then found the price good, the overall sentiment might be positive because they are happy with the product despite the initial shock. \n\nBut I'm still not 100% sure. Given that there's a mix of emotions, but the final statement is about the price being good, which is a strong positive, maybe it's POSITIVE. However, if \"bayildim\" is considered a strong negative, then it might be NEGATIVE. But in the absence of clear context, I think the safest label here would be NEUTRAL because there are both positive and negative elements without one clearly dominating.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Then, \"hemen sivilcelerim söndü\" translates to \"my pimples disappeared immediately.\" The word \"söndü\" here is important because it indicates that the product had a positive effect on the user's skin issue.\n\nThe user is expressing satisfaction with the product's effectiveness. There's no negative language here. Words like \"çok güzel\" and the successful outcome of the pimples disappearing are strong indicators of a positive sentiment. Even though there's a mention of a problem (pimples), the resolution of that problem through the product is framed positively.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden negative meaning, but in this case, it seems straightforward.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the given text: \"küçük ama sevimli\". The user wants a sentiment analysis in JSON format with one of the labels POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the Turkish sentence. \"Küçük\" means small, and \"sevimli\" means cute or charming. The conjunction \"ama\" is used here, which can sometimes indicate a contrast. However, in this case, the structure is \"small but cute\". Even though there's a contrast, the overall sentiment seems positive because being cute is a strong positive trait. The use of \"ama\" doesn't necessarily make it negative; it might just be highlighting that despite being small, it's still cute. \n\nI should check if there are any negative connotations. \"Küçük\" alone could be neutral or slightly negative depending on context, but paired with \"sevimli\", the positive aspect overrides it. There's no explicit negative language here. The sentence is more about describing something in a favorable way. \n\nSo, the sentiment is likely POSITIVE. I need to make sure there's no ambiguity. Since the user provided examples where similar structures were labeled as positive, this fits into that category. No need for NEUTRAL here because the adjectives used are clearly positive.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user wrote: \"uygulaması kolay, renk güzel ancak beyazlar çabuk çıkıyor.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break it down into parts. The first two parts are positive: \"uygulaması kolay\" (easy to use) and \"renk güzel\" (nice color). These are clear positives.\n\nThen there's the conjunction \"ancak\" which means \"but,\" indicating a contrast. The next part is \"beyazlar çabuk çıkıyor\" (whites come out quickly). This seems negative because it's pointing out a flaw or issue with the product, possibly related to durability or quality.\n\nSo the sentiment isn't entirely positive or negative. There are both positive and negative aspects mentioned. However, in the context of sentiment analysis, if there's a mix but one part is more critical (like a defect), it might lean towards negative. But sometimes, if the positives are strong enough, it could be neutral. \n\nWait, the user instructions say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The example for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is more of a mixed but acceptable comment. Here, the user mentions both good and bad points. However, the negative part might be more significant because it's pointing out a problem that could affect the product's usability or satisfaction. But I need to check if the overall sentiment is more negative than positive.\n\nAlternatively, since there are two positives and one negative, maybe it's neutral. But sometimes in such cases, the presence of a negative aspect can make the whole sentiment negative. However, the example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is a balanced view. So perhaps here, even with a negative point, if the user is still using the product and mentioning both pros and cons, it's neutral.\n\nBut I need to be careful. The key is whether the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. If the negatives are more impactful, then NEGATIVE. If it's a balanced view, NEUTRAL. Since the user mentions two positives and one negative, but the negative is about a specific issue (whites coming out quickly), which might be a significant drawback for some users. However, without more context on how critical that issue is, it's hard to say. But according to standard sentiment analysis practices, mixed sentiments with both positive and negative aspects are often labeled as NEUTRAL unless the negatives are overwhelming.\n\nSo in this case, I think the correct label would be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The sentence seems a bit fragmented, maybe due to typos or shorthand. Let me break it down.\n\n\"3 oldu kullanmaya başlayalı daha fazla bşr etkisini görmedim\" – The user mentions starting to use something (maybe a product or medication) and not seeing more effects. \"bşr\" might be a typo for \"bir\" (one), so maybe \"daha fazla bir etkisini görmedim\" which translates to \"I haven't seen more of an effect.\"\n\nThen, \"ilk sürdüğümde hafif bçr aydınlanma oluyor yüzümde.\" – \"ilk sürdüğümde\" could be \"when I first used it,\" and \"hafif bir aydınlanma\" is \"a slight illumination\" on the face. Maybe they're talking about a skincare product or something that causes a mild glowing effect.\n\nNow, analyzing the sentiment. The user isn't explicitly happy or sad. They mention not seeing more effects after starting to use it, which could be neutral or slightly negative. However, there's a mention of a slight positive effect (aydınlanma) initially.

The person starts by saying \"Koku çok güzel\" which translates to \"The smell is very nice.\" That's a positive statement. But then they use \"ancak malesef\" meaning \"but unfortunately,\" which introduces a negative aspect. They mention that the longevity (kalıcılığı) is low, and it decreases to almost nothing within 1-2 hours.\n\nSo there's a mix of positive and negative elements. The initial part is positive, but the latter part points out a significant drawback. In sentiment analysis, when there's a contrast like this, the overall sentiment can be tricky. However, the user's instructions specify using only POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. \n\nThe key here is to determine which part dominates. The positive comment is about the smell, but the negative part talks about the product's durability, which might be a critical factor for the user. Since the negative aspect is introduced with \"malesef\" (unfortunately), it's likely that the overall sentiment leans towards negative because the drawback is significant and affects the product's effectiveness. \n\nHowever, sometimes in such cases, if both positive and negative are present without one clearly overpowering the other, NEUTRAL might be considered. But given that the user mentions a major downside (low longevity) after praising the smell, it's more likely to be NEGATIVE because the negative aspect is a deal-breaker for many users. \n\nI should check if there's any ambiguity.

The word \"pek\" is a negation here, so it's downplaying the success. Then there's \"bulmadım\", which means \"I didn't find\" or \"I didn't consider\". The user probably meant \"Pek başarılı bulmadım\" (I didn't find it very successful). \n\nThe suffix \"-dm\" might be a typo for \"-dim\", so \"bulmadım\" is correct.

So putting it all together, the user is expressing disappointment or regret about something not being successful.\n\nLooking at the sentiment tags: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL.

Then they mention that there's no Turkish explanation in the short note, which could be a negative aspect. However, they also say they tried it and are very satisfied (\"denedim gayet memnun kaldım\"), which is clearly positive. They add a tip about steaming the pores before use for better results, which seems like a helpful suggestion rather than a complaint.\n\nNow, I need to weigh these points. The positive aspects (quality packaging, satisfaction with the product) seem to outweigh the minor negative point about the lack of Turkish instructions. The user is overall happy with the product and even provides a useful tip, indicating they're satisfied despite the small inconvenience. \n\nI should check if there's any other negative language I might have missed.

Then \"en ucuz burda bence\" means \"I think it's the cheapest here.\" The user is saying that the product is available at the lowest price, which is a good thing. The smiley face \":)\" adds to the positive sentiment.\n\nSo combining these elements: praising the scent and mentioning the low price, both are positive aspects. There's no negative language here.

Çamaşır olduğu için iade de yok.\" Translating that to English: \"A few sizes too big, very small. Because it's underwear, there's no return.\" \n\nFirst, the user is talking about a product (probably underwear) being the wrong size. They mention it's too big and then say it's very small, which seems contradictory. Wait, maybe they meant that the size was incorrect? Maybe they ordered a larger size but received a smaller one? Or perhaps there's confusion in the translation.\n\nNext part: \"Çamaşır olduğu için iade de yok.\" So because it's underwear, returns aren't possible. The user is expressing frustration about not being able to return the item due to its nature. \n\nLooking at the sentiment, they're pointing out a problem with the product size and the lack of return policy. That sounds negative. However, sometimes people might be neutral if they just state facts without strong emotions. But here, the mention of \"iade de yok\" (no returns) adds a negative aspect because it's a limitation imposed by the seller. \n\nBut wait, maybe the user is just stating the situation without being overly upset? The first part about the size might be neutral if they're just informing, but combined with the lack of return options, it leans more towards negative. However, in Turkish, sometimes people use phrases like \"çok küçük\" (very small) even if they meant it's not the right size. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo or confusion in the text. If the user said \"bir kaç beden büyük alınmalı çok küçük,\" that could mean they thought they should have ordered a few sizes bigger but received something too small. That would be a negative experience because the product didn't meet their expectations and they can't return it. \n\nSo overall, the sentiment is likely NEGATIVE due to the dissatisfaction with the product size and the inability to return it.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Since the user is expressing that they didn't like something, this should be a negative sentiment. The use of \"pek\" adds emphasis to the negation, making it stronger. There's no ambiguity here; the sentiment is clearly negative. So the correct label would be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

But then there's a problem with the charging after the battery dies. The user is expressing dissatisfaction because the product stopped working after that issue. Even though there's an initial positive comment, the main issue here is the malfunction of the product, which leads to a negative experience overall.\n\nThe key points are the initial satisfaction but the subsequent failure of the product.

The user is expressing a willingness to test something and observe the outcome.\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"deneyip\" (try), \"bakıcaz\" (we'll look), \"görücez\" (we'll see). These words don't carry strong positive or negative connotations. They're more about taking action and observing, which is neutral in nature. There's no explicit praise or criticism here. The user isn't expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction; they're just stating an intention to test and observe. \n\nConsidering the context, this could be a response to a product or service offering, where the user is indicating they'll try it before making a judgment.

I need to analyze this and determine the sentiment label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The first part is \"Kokusu çok güzel\" which translates to \"The smell is very nice.\" That's clearly a positive statement. Then there's \"ama ürün biraz küçük\" meaning \"but the product is a bit small.\" This part is negative because it points out a drawback.\n\nNow, the challenge is combining these two parts. The user is expressing both a positive and a negative aspect. In sentiment analysis, when there are mixed sentiments, the overall label can be tricky. However, the rules here specify that if there's a mix, we need to determine which part dominates or if it's neutral.\n\nLooking at the example given in the instructions: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" translates to \"It's okay for the price,\" which is considered NEUTRAL. That suggests that when there's a balance between positive and negative elements without clear dominance, it might be labeled as neutral.\n\nIn this case, the user starts with a strong positive (\"çok güzel\") but then follows with a negative point (\"biraz küçük\"). The conjunction \"ama\" (but) indicates a contrast. However, since both aspects are present and neither is overwhelmingly dominant, the overall sentiment might lean towards NEUTRAL because it's a mix of positive and negative without one clearly overpowering the other.\n\nAlternatively, if the positive part was stronger or more significant, it could be POSITIVE, but here the negative aspect is also notable. The product's size being small could affect satisfaction, even if the smell is good. Therefore, considering both parts are important and neither is negligible, NEUTRAL seems appropriate.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The part about thinking it was quality might be a bit confusing, but the overall sentiment is clearly negative because the user is expressing dissatisfaction and advising against purchasing. \n\nSo even though there's a mention of expecting quality, the actual experience was bad enough to not recommend.

Then they say \"naturel değil tam olarak\" meaning \"not exactly natural\" or \"not really natural\".\n\nSo the person is pointing out that the color is too obvious and not natural. That sounds like a negative comment because they're criticizing the product's appearance. Words like \"bayağı belli oluyor\" (very noticeable) might be negative if it's implying something unwanted, like the color being too artificial or not authentic. The mention of it not being natural could also be a negative point, especially if the product is supposed to look natural.\n\nI should check if there's any positive aspect here, but I don't see any.

The user wrote, \"Çok beğendim ama pahalı maalesef.\" Translating that to English, it's \"I really liked it but it's expensive unfortunately.\" \n\nFirst, the positive part is clear: \"Çok beğendim\" which means \"I really liked it.\" That's a strong positive sentiment. However, the second part \"ama pahalı maalesef\" translates to \"but it's expensive unfortunately.\" The word \"ama\" introduces a contrast, so there's a negative aspect here about the price.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The user has both positive and negative elements. But in sentiment analysis, when there are conflicting sentiments, we have to see which one is stronger or if they balance out. The use of \"ama\" (but) usually indicates that the second part is a drawback, but the first part is still a strong positive.\n\nHowever, the instruction says to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there's both positive and negative, but the main sentiment might be neutral because the user is expressing both sides. But wait, sometimes if one part is stronger. The word \"çok beğendim\" is very strong positive, while \"pahalı\" is a negative point. However, in some cases, when there's a mix of positive and negative, it could be neutral. But I need to check the rules again.\n\nThe user provided examples where mixed sentiments might lead to NEUTRAL. For example, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is \"Okay considering the price,\" leading to NEUTRAL. In this case, the user liked it but found it expensive. So maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because there's a positive and a negative aspect. However, sometimes if the positive is stronger, it might be positive. But in the example given by the user, \"Yemek harikaydı.\" (The food was amazing) is POSITIVE, while \"Zehirlendim.\" (I got poisoned) is NEGATIVE. So when there's a mix, like here, maybe NEUTRAL.\n\nBut I should check if the presence of both positive and negative makes it neutral. The user might be satisfied but concerned about the price. However, in some cases, the overall sentiment could still be positive because they liked it despite the price. But according to standard sentiment analysis practices, when there's a clear contrast with both positive and negative elements, it's often considered NEUTRAL unless one is overwhelmingly stronger.\n\nIn this case, \"çok beğendim\" is strong positive, but \"pahalı\" is a negative point. However, the user might be expressing that they liked it but are disappointed about the price. So maybe the overall sentiment is mixed, leading to NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Both parts of the sentence are positive. There's no negative language here, and the recommendation adds to the positive sentiment. The user might be talking about a product, like perfume or something fragrant. Even if there's a slight ambiguity, the overall tone is definitely positive. No neutral words here either. So the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

They also mention no breakouts or irritation. Finally, they recommend it for very dry skin.\n\nPositive points: They are satisfied with the cream, mention using it on face and neck, and recommend it for dry skin. The absence of irritation is a plus.\n\nNegative points: The cream isn't suitable under makeup, causing shine during the day. They have to adjust usage to nighttime only after a mask, which might be a drawback for some users.\n\nNeutral aspects: The recommendation is conditional (\"especially if your skin is very dry\"), so it's not universally positive. The user has a specific use case but overall seems satisfied despite the limitation.\n\nOverall sentiment leans positive because the user is happy with the product's effectiveness for their dry skin and lack of irritation, even though there's a negative aspect about makeup compatibility.

First, I need to understand what \"fena değil\" means in Turkish. \"Fena\" usually translates to something like \"bad\" or \"not good,\" but when used with \"değil,\" which is \"not,\" it becomes a bit tricky.\n\nWait, \"fena değil\" literally means \"not bad.\" In Turkish, this phrase is often used to express that something is okay or average. It's not overly positive, but it's also not negative. So the sentiment here is more neutral. Let me think of examples. If someone says \"Bu ürün fena değil,\" they might mean it's acceptable, but not excellent. \n\nLooking at the rules again: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. Since the user didn't express strong positive or negative emotions, but rather a moderate or neutral stance, the correct label should be NEUTRAL. The example given in the instructions where \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL is similar.

The phrase is clearly positive because both \"gayet\" and \"güzel\" are positive words. There's no negative connotation here. Even if someone might think \"gayet\" could be neutral, in this context, it's intensifying \"güzel,\" which is definitely positive.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but the text is straightforward.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a Turkish text that needs to be analyzed for sentiment. The text is: \"aslında güzel bı ürün ama zamanla far durdukça rengi kayboluyo kalıcı değil.onun dışında renkler ve kokusu çok güzel\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user starts by saying \"aslında güzel bir ürün\" which translates to \"actually a good product.\" Then they mention that over time, the color fades (\"zamanla far durdukça rengi kayboluyo kalıcı değil\"), indicating a negative point about durability. However, they also say that the colors and scent are very nice (\"renkler ve kokusu çok güzel\").\n\nSo there's both positive and negative aspects here. The initial sentiment is positive, but there's a complaint about the color fading. But the user ends on a positive note regarding other features. In such cases, where there are mixed sentiments, the overall label might depend on which aspect is more emphasized.\n\nHowever, according to the rules given, I need to determine if it's POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The example for NEUTRAL was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is a neutral statement. In this case, the user has both positive and negative points but doesn't have an overall strong sentiment. However, sometimes in such cases, if there are more positives than negatives or vice versa, it might lean one way.\n\nBut looking at the structure: the user starts with \"aslında güzel\" (actually good), then mentions a negative point, but then says \"onun dışında renkler ve kokusu çok güzel\" (other than that, colors and scent are very nice). So they're pointing out a flaw but still highlighting other positive aspects. This might be considered more neutral because the negatives are acknowledged but not overwhelming, and positives are also present.\n\nAlternatively, if the negative point is about a key feature (like durability), it could tip towards negative. But since the user ends with another positive statement, maybe it's balanced. However, in sentiment analysis, sometimes even one strong negative can make it negative, but here it's more of a mixed review.\n\nBut according to the examples given, if there are both positives and negatives but no clear dominance, NEUTRAL might be appropriate. The user isn't overly positive or negative overall; they're pointing out pros and cons. So I think the correct label here is NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Even though the reaction is described as mild (\"hafif\"), the fact that it's causing discomfort and leading to discontinuation of use indicates a negative experience.\n\nThe sentiment here isn't neutral because there's a clear adverse effect reported.

The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product size. They expected a certain size but found it too small, which led to them not liking it.\n\nLooking at the sentiment labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. Since the user clearly states they didn't like the product due to the size being incorrect, this is a negative experience. The mention of not liking it directly points to a negative sentiment.

So the person is saying they liked how someone was toned down or their manner.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. Since the user used \"beğendim,\" which is clearly positive, the label should be POSITIVE. There's no negative language here, and it's not neutral because there's a clear expression of liking something.\n\nI need to make sure there are no hidden negatives or sarcasm, but the sentence seems straightforward.

First, I need to analyze this in Turkish.\n\nBreaking it down, \"sadece\" means \"only\", \"biyil\" is probably a typo for \"beyaz\" (white) or maybe \"bilgi\" (information), but given the context, maybe \"beyaz\" makes more sense. Then \"aliyor\" is \"is taking\" and \"kas almiyor\" would be \"not taking muscles\". Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's a typo for \"kilo almiyor\" (not gaining weight)? That would make the sentence: \"Only white is taking, not gaining weight.\" But that still feels off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"biyil\" is a misspelling of \"beyaz\" and \"kas\" is muscle. So the user might be saying something like \"Only white is taking, muscles are not being taken.\" That's confusing. Maybe it's about a product or service where only certain aspects are being addressed, but others aren't. The sentiment here seems negative because they're pointing out that despite some action (taking), other important aspects (muscles) are not being addressed.

So the first part is saying something arrived on time and was super, which sounds positive. Then there's \"10\". In Turkish, giving a 10 out of 10 is a perfect score, so that's definitely positive.\n\nPutting it all together: The user is expressing satisfaction with something arriving on time and giving it a top rating.

That also seems positive because they're aligning it correctly.\n\nPutting both parts together: They liked the usage and aligned it appropriately. There's no negative language here, just approval and proper alignment. No sarcasm or hidden meanings that might indicate a different sentiment. The words used are straightforward and positive.

The person hasn't tried the product yet, so they're expressing uncertainty. They mention hoping it doesn't irritate their face, which is a negative outcome they're worried about. However, there's no explicit positive or negative statement about the product itself. They're just expressing a hope that something bad doesn't happen.\n\nLooking at the rules again: POSITIVE is for clear positive statements, NEGATIVE for clear negatives, and NEUTRAL if it's neither.

The key words here are \"koku güzel\" which means \"the smell is nice\" or \"the scent is good.\" However, the phrase \"fiyata göre\" translates to \"in terms of price\" or \"considering the price.\" \n\nSo the user is saying that despite the price, the scent is good. This could be a positive statement because they're highlighting a positive aspect (good smell) even though there might be an implication about the price being high. But wait, the phrase doesn't explicitly say the price is high or low. It's more about the value for money.\n\nIn Turkish, when someone says \"fiyata göre\" and then mentions a positive attribute, it often means that the product is good considering its price. So even if the price is high, the quality (in this case, the scent) justifies it. That would be a positive sentiment because they're satisfied with the product's value.\n\nAlternatively, if the user had said \"fiyata göre koku kötü,\" that would be negative. But here, \"güzel\" is positive. So the overall sentiment should be positive. The user isn't complaining; they're pointing out a good quality in relation to the price.

The task is to classify it as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The user starts with \"Çok güzel bir ürün\" which translates to \"Very beautiful product,\" so that's a positive statement. Then they mention \"ancak bu tonu çok renksiz\" meaning \"but this tone is very dull,\" which is negative.

However, they praise the \"kapatıcılığı gayet güzel\" meaning \"the closure is very good,\" which is positive. Finally, they mention it looks small and warns not to be deceived by the appearance, which could be neutral or slightly negative.\n\nNow, I need to weigh these points. The review has both positive and negative aspects. The user starts with a strong positive, but then lists some negatives about the color and appearance. However, there's also a positive note about the closure. Since there are mixed sentiments, but no overwhelming negativity or positivity, the overall sentiment might be NEUTRAL. But I need to check if the positives and negatives balance out. The initial praise is strong, but the criticisms are specific issues that might not outweigh the positives. Alternatively, since there are clear negative points mentioned, maybe it's NEGATIVE. Wait, but the user also mentions a positive aspect. Hmm.\n\nIn Turkish reviews, sometimes people mention both pros and cons. If the overall sentiment isn't clearly leaning one way, NEUTRAL is appropriate. However, if the negatives are more impactful, it might be NEGATIVE. The user says \"ancak\" (but) which introduces the negative points, but then continues with a positive about the closure. The final part about the size being misleading could be a neutral observation.

The text is in Turkish, so I need to make sure I understand the nuances correctly.\n\nThe user starts by saying \"Parlamayı giderdiği doğru\" which translates to \"It's correct that it removes flaking.\" That sounds positive. But then they mention \"yüzünüzde gün boyu yapış yapış bir his oluşturuyor\" meaning \"it creates a sticky feeling on your face all day.\" That's negative. \n\nNext, they say \"Cildinizin parlamaması için bir işlem uygulamışsınız yüzünüzde maskeyle geziyor gibisiniz.\" Which translates to \"You've applied a process to prevent your skin from flaking, making you look like you're wearing a mask.\" This part is neutral because it's stating a fact without clear positive or negative sentiment.\n\nSo the review has both positive and negative elements.

The word \"kalitesiz\" is clearly negative. When someone says something is very low quality, that's a strong negative statement. There's no ambiguity here.

They mention that they started experiencing itching and are unsure if the product caused it, leading them to stop using it.\n\nThe key points here are the negative experience (itching) and the decision to discontinue use. The uncertainty about causation doesn't change the fact that the outcome was negative. Even though there's a bit of ambiguity (\"bilmiyorum\" - I don't know), the overall sentiment is negative because the user had an adverse reaction and stopped using the product.\n\nI should check if there's any positive or neutral elements, but in this case, the main focus is on the negative effect. The mention of stopping use reinforces that the experience was unpleasant enough to lead to discontinuation. So the label here would be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The key words are \"fazla hoş\" which translates to \"not very pleasant\" and \"hitap etmedi\" meaning \"didn't appeal\". Both of these phrases indicate a negative experience. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the smell, so the sentiment is clearly negative.\n\nI should check if there's any neutral or positive elements, but in this case, the entire sentence is about something not being pleasant and not appealing.

The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's performance and value for money.

The phrase \"umarım\" translates to \"I hope,\" which usually indicates a positive expectation. However, the context is about something happening before another action is completed. The person is expressing a wish or hope for an event to occur before a certain point.\n\nNow, considering the possible sentiments: Positive, Negative, Neutral. The sentence itself doesn't contain overtly negative words like \"hate\" or \"disappointed,\" nor does it have clearly positive words like \"love\" or \"excellent.\" It's more of a neutral statement expressing a hope without any strong emotional charge. \n\nThe user might be in a situation where they want something to happen quickly, but the sentence doesn't convey frustration or satisfaction. It's just a straightforward expression of hope.

The use of \"hem... hem...\" (both... and...) emphasizes that two issues are being addressed positively. \n\nThe key words here are \"çok güzel\" and the positive outcomes mentioned.

The user mentions that the underarm area gets wet if you move a lot, and when you sweat, it leaves yellow stains on white clothes. They also mention applying deodorant to keep it dry longer. \n\nHmm, the initial part talks about a problem: sweating leading to dampness and stains. That sounds negative. But then the user mentions using deodorant as a solution, which is a positive action. However, the overall sentiment here seems more like pointing out an issue with the product (maybe a deodorant or clothing) but also providing a workaround.\n\nWait, the text isn't directly praising or criticizing a product. It's more about explaining a situation and a solution. The user isn't expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a product; they're just sharing their experience and method to handle the problem. \n\nSo, the key points are: the underarm gets wet, causes stains on white clothes, but using deodorant helps keep it dry longer. There's no explicit positive or negative emotion here. It's more of a neutral explanation of a situation and a solution. The user isn't happy or unhappy; they're just informing about their method to manage the issue.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment should be NEUTRAL because there's no strong positive or negative feeling expressed.

The text is: \"Her zaman zirve hele de düz saç seviyorsanız kuaförden çıkmış gibi yapıyor kurutmadan önce kullanınca\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context and the sentiment here. The user mentions \"zirve\" which can mean peak or top, but in this context, it might be a brand name. Then there's \"düz saç seviyorsanız\" which translates to \"if you like straight hair\". The phrase \"kuaförden çıkmış gibi yapıyor\" means \"makes you look like you just came out of the salon\", which is positive. However, the sentence structure is a bit confusing. The user might be talking about a product that helps achieve straight hair without drying, but there's some ambiguity.\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"zirve\" could be a brand, \"düz saç\" is straight hair, \"kuaförden çıkmış gibi\" is positive, but the rest of the sentence is a bit unclear. The user might be giving advice on using a product before drying. However, there's no clear positive or negative sentiment expressed here. It's more of a neutral instruction or recommendation.\n\nI need to check if there are any negative words. Words like \"zehirlendim\" (poisoned) in the example were negative, but here there's nothing like that. The sentence is more about how the product works, which is neutral.

Then there's \"İadee edeceğim\", which means \"I will return it\" or \"I'm going to refund it\". The repetition of \"kötü\" (bad) emphasizes the negative feeling. The user is clearly expressing dissatisfaction, so the sentiment here is definitely negative. There's no positive language or neutral terms that might suggest ambiguity.

I don't like it at all, but I have to use it.\" \n\nFirst part: \"Çok silik bir siyah\" – \"silik\" means dull or lackluster. So they're describing the color as not vibrant, which is negative.\n\nSecond part: \"Hiç beğenmedim mecbur kullanıyorum\" – \"Hiç beğenmedim\" is \"I don't like it at all,\" which is clearly negative. The second clause \"mecbur kullanıyorum\" means \"have to use it,\" indicating they're forced to use it despite not liking it. That adds to the negative sentiment.\n\nSo combining both parts, the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the color and being compelled to use it. There's no positive language here.

The sentence is neutral in terms of emotion. The user is stating a fact about starting to use something, without expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Words like \"yeni\" (new) might be neutral here.

That sounds negative because they're criticizing the product's suitability based on the material's thickness. \n\nSo, the sentiment here is negative.

Then \"Gayet\" translates to very or quite, which is an intensifier. \"Başarılı\" means successful or accomplished, another positive word. \"Kargolama\" refers to shipping or delivery, probably in the context of a service.\n\nPutting it all together: The user is talking about a shipping experience and using positive adjectives. Words like \"güzel\" and \"başarılı\" are clearly positive. Even though \"gayet\" is just an intensifier, it strengthens the positive sentiment. There's no negative language here. So the overall sentiment should be positive.\n\nI need to make sure there's no sarcasm or hidden meaning, but in Turkish, unless there's a context clue, these words are straightforward.

The sentiment here seems negative because they're expressing frustration that even something as thin as a leg can't fit through. There's no positive language, just a complaint about the narrowness.

The phrase \"İçinde yokmuş gibi\" translates to something like \"as if there was nothing inside\" or \"like it wasn't there.\" That might indicate disappointment or confusion.\n\nThe word \"bişey\" is a colloquial Turkish term for \"something,\" so the sentence is saying that the person left without any explanation.

Words like \"zor\" (difficult) are negative. The part about not leaving an oily feeling might be positive, but the overall experience seems frustrating. The user is highlighting multiple issues with the product's usability and effectiveness. Even though there's a neutral comment about it being similar to shampoo, the main points are about difficulty in use and time-consuming process. \n\nConsidering all that, the sentiment leans towards negative because the user is expressing frustration with the product's performance and ease of use.

However, the user's instructions say to use only POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. \n\nWait, but what if someone uses multiple thumbs-up for sarcasm? Though that's less common.

Then they mention that it didn't cause any issues on their sensitive skin, which is another positive point. They also note that there was a slight sticky feeling at first but it went away quickly. The use of emojis like 👍🏻 and the phrase \"ecmele selamm\" (which might be a typo for \"ecemle selam\" meaning \"hello to ecem\") adds to the positive sentiment.

The text is in Turkish, so I need to make sure I understand the nuances correctly.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that the color is darker than shown in the image, both for the stone and metal parts. That sounds negative because it's a discrepancy between expectation and reality. Then they say the price was reasonable, which is a positive point, hence the 3 stars. However, they're unsure about the naturalness of the stone, which adds another layer of uncertainty or concern.\n\nSo, there are mixed elements here: negative aspects (color difference, uncertainty about the stone's quality) and a neutral/positive note about the price. But the overall sentiment seems more negative because the main product issues (color and stone quality) are mentioned first, and the positive aspect is just a mitigating factor. The user isn't fully satisfied but gives a moderate rating. However, according to the rules, I need to pick one label. Since there's a clear complaint about the product not meeting expectations and uncertainty about quality, even though the price is mentioned positively, the dominant sentiment here leans negative.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

            "label": "ERROR",
            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a Turkish text that needs to be analyzed for sentiment. The text is: \"Boyu Beklediğimden de büyük geldi sürekli kullandığım favorim yıkama jeli\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. Translating it to English might help. It says something like, \"The height was bigger than expected, my favorite washing gel that I use continuously.\" Wait, maybe \"favorim\" is \"my favorite\"? So the user is talking about a product, probably a shampoo or gel, which they use regularly.\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment. The first part mentions that the height (maybe of the product?) was bigger than expected. That could be negative if it's unexpected and not desired. But then they mention \"favorim\" (my favorite) and \"sürekli kullandığım\" (use continuously), which are positive aspects. \n\nBut wait, the structure might be a bit different. The sentence seems to have two parts: the first part is about the size being larger than expected, which could be negative. The second part is about it being their favorite and used regularly, which is positive. However, in Turkish, sometimes the context can change based on punctuation or structure. \n\nWait, maybe the user is saying that even though the height was bigger than expected (which might be a negative point), they still use it as their favorite washing gel continuously. So there's a contrast here. But does that make the overall sentiment positive, negative, or neutral?\n\nIn such cases, if there's both positive and negative elements but no clear dominance, it might be neutral. However, the fact that they mention it's their favorite and used regularly could outweigh the initial negative point about size. Alternatively, maybe the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the size but still using it because it's their favorite. \n\nBut in sentiment analysis, we need to determine the overall sentiment. If the positive aspects (favorite product) are stronger than the negative (size), then it might be positive. However, if the negative aspect is a complaint that isn't resolved by the positive, maybe neutral. But since they continue using it despite the size issue, perhaps the positive sentiment is more dominant.\n\nAlternatively, the mention of \"favorim\" and \"sürekli kullandığım\" are strong positives, so even though there's a minor negative point about size, the overall sentiment might still be positive. However, sometimes in Turkish, the structure can be tricky. Let me check again.\n\nThe sentence: \"Boyu Beklediğimden de büyük geldi sürekli kullandığım favorim yıkama jeli\". The first part is \"Boyu Beklediğimden de büyük geldi\" which translates to \"It came larger than I expected.\" Then the second part is \"sürekli kullandığım favorim yıkama jeli\" meaning \"my favorite washing gel that I use continuously.\"\n\nSo, the user is saying that even though it was bigger than expected (which might be a negative), they still use their favorite product. The fact that they mention it's their favorite and used regularly suggests a positive sentiment despite the initial issue. However, the presence of both positive and negative elements could lead to neutral. But in many cases, if the user continues using it as their favorite, the overall sentiment is more positive.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. If the main point is that they are happy with the product despite the size, then positive. If the size issue is a complaint but they still use it, maybe neutral. However, in Turkish reviews, sometimes people mention a minor negative but overall are satisfied. \n\nAlternatively, the structure might be that \"Boyu Beklediğimden de büyük geldi\" is a negative point, and the rest is positive. But since both parts are present, the sentiment could be neutral because there's a mix of positive and negative. However, in some cases, the positive aspects (using it as favorite) might override the negative.\n\nBut I think in this case, the user is pointing out that even though the size was bigger than expected (negative), they still use it as their favorite (positive). So the overall sentiment could be neutral because there's a mix. However, sometimes the presence of \"favorim\" and \"sürekli kullandığım\" might indicate more positive sentiment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expressing that despite the size being bigger than expected, they still prefer it, so the sentiment is positive. But I'm not entirely sure. It's a bit ambiguous. However, in many cases, if someone mentions using something as their favorite and continuously, even with a minor negative point, the overall sentiment would be positive.\n\nBut to be safe, maybe neutral because there are both positive and negative elements. However, in some contexts, the positive aspects might dominate. I need to check examples again. For instance, if the user says \"It was bigger than expected but I still use it as my favorite,\" that's a mix. But in sentiment analysis, sometimes the presence of strong positive words like \"favorim\" and \"sürekli kullandığım\" could tip it towards positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the negative part is just a minor inconvenience, so overall positive. So the label would be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user wrote, \"ürün güzel ama daha da iyi olabilir,\" which translates to \"The product is nice but could be better.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The word \"güzel\" (nice) is positive, so that's a positive indicator. However, the phrase \"ama daha da iyi olabilir\" (but could be better) introduces a negative aspect. The user is pointing out a potential improvement, which suggests some level of dissatisfaction or a suggestion for enhancement.\n\nNow, considering the rules provided, I need to determine if this is positive, negative, or neutral. The presence of both positive and negative elements complicates things. But in sentiment analysis, when there's a mix, it often depends on the overall tone. Here, the user starts with a positive remark but follows it with a critical note. However, the use of \"ama\" (but) usually indicates that the second part is more significant. \n\nBut wait, the example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which means \"Okay considering the price.\" That's a neutral statement because it's acknowledging the product's value despite possible shortcomings. In this case, the user isn't just saying it's okay; they're pointing out that it could be better. However, since they still acknowledge it as \"güzel,\" maybe it's leaning towards positive but with a suggestion.\n\nBut according to standard sentiment analysis practices, if there's both positive and negative elements without clear dominance, it might be neutral. However, in some cases, the presence of a positive term followed by a negative one could be seen as mixed, but since the options are only POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL, I need to choose the best fit.\n\nLooking at the examples again: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. Here, the user isn't just saying it's okay; they're saying it's good but could be better. That might lean more towards negative because they're pointing out a flaw. However, the initial positive statement might balance it.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user for neutral, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is considered neutral. So if the user says something is good but could be better, maybe that's also neutral? Or does the presence of a negative aspect make it negative?\n\nHmm. In some sentiment analysis models, mixed sentiments can be classified as neutral if there's no clear dominance. However, in other contexts, the presence of any negative feedback might tip it to negative. But since the user is still acknowledging the product as \"güzel,\" maybe it's more positive with a suggestion.\n\nBut I need to follow the examples strictly. The example given for neutral was when the user says \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is a balanced statement. In this case, the user is saying the product is good but could be better. That might be similar to the example, so maybe it's neutral.\n\nAlternatively, if the user had said \"ürün kötü ama daha da iyi olabilir,\" that would be negative with a suggestion. But here, the initial adjective is positive. So perhaps the overall sentiment is still positive, but with a minor negative note. However, in the absence of clear dominance, it might be neutral.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The key is whether the user's main sentiment is positive or negative. If they start with \"güzel\" and then add a suggestion for improvement, maybe the overall sentiment is still positive but with a note. However, in some cases, that could be seen as neutral because it's not strongly positive or negative.\n\nAlternatively, if the user had said \"ürün güzel ama çok pahalı,\" that might be more neutral. But here, the criticism is about potential improvement rather than a major flaw. So maybe it's still leaning towards positive but with a suggestion for improvement, making it neutral.\n\nI think in this case, since there's both positive and negative elements without clear dominance, the correct label would be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user is talking about a product, probably skincare or makeup, given the mention of oiliness and coverage. The key positive words are \"tüm yüze yetiyor\" (covers the whole face), \"yağlı his bırakmıyor\" (doesn't leave an oily feeling), and \"çok güzel\" (very nice). These are all positive attributes.\n\nThere's a contrast with \"boyu küçük ama\" (small in size but), which might initially seem negative, but the user follows it up with positive outcomes.

The user is satisfied with the product's performance despite its small size. \n\nI should check if there's any hidden sarcasm or negative connotations, but the words used are straightforwardly positive.

Translating it, \"Normal güzel bir temizleyici\" means \"A normal good cleaner.\" \n\nNow, breaking down the words: \"Normal\" is neutral, just stating a fact. \"Güzel\" means good or nice, which is positive. But the structure here might be important. The phrase \"normal güzel\" could imply that it's good but not exceptional. So maybe the user is saying it's decent but not outstanding.\n\nIn sentiment analysis, if there's a mix of neutral and positive terms, but no strong negative words, it might lean towards positive or neutral. However, since \"güzellik\" (beauty) is present, even if tempered by \"normal,\" the overall sentiment could still be positive. But sometimes in Turkish, \"normal güzel\" can be used to mean just average, which might be more neutral.\n\nWait, but the example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which translates to \"Okay considering the price.\" So when there's a qualification that makes it not strongly positive or negative. Here, \"normal güzel\" might be similar. The user isn't overly enthusiastic but isn't negative either. \n\nSo maybe the correct label is NEUTRAL because it's a balanced statement without strong positive or negative indicators. Even though \"güzellik\" is present, the modifier \"normal\" brings it down to a neutral stance. Alternatively, if \"güzellik\" is enough to make it positive despite \"normal,\" then POSITIVE.

However, the second part mentions \"farklı koku isteyenler için denenebilir\", which translates to \"can be tried by those who want a different scent\". The word \"denenebilir\" (can be tried) might imply that it's an option, not necessarily a strong recommendation. \n\nBut there's no explicit negative language here. The user is sharing their experience of getting a discount and suggesting the product for people with specific preferences. There's no complaint or dissatisfaction expressed.

Alternatively, if they were satisfied with the comb's performance despite the hair loss, it might be neutral. But the context here is about their own hair issue, not the comb's effectiveness.

Fena değil ama ben sprey olanı tercih edicem bir sonrakinde.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the sentiment here. The user starts with \"Sevemedim\" which means they didn't like it. Then they mention the product is very transparent (şefaf), but it's moisturizing and softens the skin. However, there's no scent. They say it's not bad (\"Fena değil\"), but they prefer the spray version next time.\n\nBreaking it down: The initial sentiment is negative because of \"Sevemedim.\" But there are some positive aspects like being moisturizing and softening the skin. However, the lack of scent might be a downside. The user ends by saying they'll choose the spray version next time, which indicates they're not fully satisfied with the current product.\n\nNow, considering the rules: I need to determine if it's POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The mixed feelings here are tricky. They mention both positive and negative points. But the overall tone seems more negative because they didn't like it enough to prefer another version. However, \"Fena değil\" is neutral. But since there's a clear preference for another product, maybe leaning towards NEGATIVE. Wait, but sometimes users might say something isn't bad but still not their favorite. In this case, the user explicitly says they'll choose the spray next time, which implies dissatisfaction with the current one. So even though there are some positives, the overall sentiment is negative.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

First, I need to understand the Turkish sentence. \"Harika ötesi\" translates to \"beyond wonderful\" or \"extraordinary,\" which is definitely positive. \"Bir koku\" means \"a scent\" or \"an aroma.\" So the whole phrase is praising the smell as extraordinary.\n\nNow, checking the rules: I must return only JSON with the label. The example shows that positive words like \"harikaydı\" (was wonderful) get \"POSITIVE\". Since \"harika ötesi\" is even stronger than just \"harika,\" it's still in the positive category. No negative words here, and it's not neutral. So the correct label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Both adjectives are positive descriptors. The conjunction \"ve\" (and) connects them, reinforcing the positive sentiment. There's no negative language here. So the label should be POSITIVE. I need to make sure there's no hidden sarcasm or context, but with just these words, it's straightforward. The example given in the instructions for similar positive terms like \"harikaydı\" (amazing) was labeled POSITIVE. Therefore, this should also be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a review in Turkish that says, \"Üründen çok memnundum ancak kenarlarındaki plastik yüzey kırıldı.\" I need to analyze this and determine the sentiment label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence: The user starts with \"Üründen çok memnundum,\" which translates to \"I am very satisfied with the product.\" That's clearly a positive statement. However, the second part is \"ancak kenarlarındaki plastik yüzey kırıldı,\" meaning \"but the plastic surface on the edges broke.\" The word \"ancak\" means \"but,\" indicating a contrast between the two parts of the sentence.\n\nSo, there's both a positive and a negative aspect here. But how does that affect the overall sentiment? In such cases, the presence of both positive and negative elements can lead to a neutral sentiment if they balance each other out. However, sometimes the dominant part might influence the label more. \n\nThe user is satisfied with the product but had a negative experience with the plastic surface breaking. The key here is whether the satisfaction outweighs the issue or vice versa. Since the user explicitly mentions being \"very satisfied\" but also points out a defect, it's a mix of positive and negative feedback. However, in sentiment analysis, if there are both positive and negative elements without one clearly dominating, it might be considered neutral. But sometimes, the presence of a complaint can tip it to negative even if there's a positive part.\n\nWait, but looking at the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" translates to \"Okay for the price,\" which is neutral. So maybe when there's both positive and negative aspects, especially with a contrast, it's considered neutral. However, in some cases, if the positive part is stronger, it might be positive. But here, the user is satisfied but had an issue. The product itself is good, but there's a problem with it. So maybe the overall sentiment is mixed, but according to the rules provided, I need to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nIn the examples given by the user, when there was both positive and negative elements, like \"Yemek harikaydı.\" (positive) vs. \"Zehirlendim.\" (negative). But in this case, the example with \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. So perhaps if there's a mix of positive and negative, but no clear dominance, it's considered NEUTRAL.\n\nTherefore, the correct label here would be NEUTRAL because the user has both positive feedback about the product and a negative comment about the plastic surface breaking. The presence of both aspects without one clearly overpowering the other leads to a neutral sentiment.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

But they mention it's good as a gloss.\n\nFirst, the main sentiment here seems mixed. The first part is negative because they didn't feel the product had a significant impact. Words like \"etkisini görmedim\" (didn't see the effect) and \"fark edilmez\" (unnoticeable) are negative indicators.\n\nHowever, the second part is positive. They mention \"gloss olarak güzel\" (good as a gloss), which is a positive remark. But the overall context is about not feeling the product's effectiveness. The positive comment is a minor point compared to the main dissatisfaction with the lack of effect.\n\nSo even though there's a positive note, the dominant sentiment here is negative because the user is primarily expressing disappointment in the product's performance.

First, I need to understand what \"uygun fiyat\" means in Turkish. \"Uygun\" translates to \"suitable\" or \"appropriate,\" and \"fiyat\" is \"price.\" So together, it means \"reasonable price\" or \"suitable price.\"\n\nNow, considering the sentiment. Words like \"uygun\" are generally positive because they indicate something is appropriate or good value. However, I should check if there's any context that might change the sentiment. But in this case, the phrase is straightforward. It's a common expression used to describe a product or service that's priced fairly. There's no negative language here. The user isn't complaining about the price being too high or low; they're just stating it's suitable.\n\nComparing to the examples given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. But \"uygun fiyat\" is more positive because \"uygun\" is a positive descriptor. So the label should be POSITIVE. I need to make sure there's no hidden sarcasm or context, but since the input is just two words without any additional context, it's safe to go with POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Even though they mention having dark circles, the overall sentiment is about the product's effectiveness and their trust in the brand.\n\nI should check for any negative words. There's \"mor bir goz cevrem\" (dark eye circles), but that's more of a neutral statement about their condition, not a complaint about the product.

The phrase \"etkisi çok fazla diyemem\" suggests that the person isn't sure about the extent of the effect, maybe they're hesitant or not fully convinced.

The second part is slightly positive. However, since there's no clear positive or negative sentiment throughout the entire sentence, maybe it's neutral overall. They aren't expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction strongly enough to be positive or negative.

Then \"kötü ambalajlama\" means \"poor packaging.\" Poor packaging can lead to damaged products, so that's definitely negative too. The last word is \"fiyasko,\" which directly translates to \"fiasco.\" That's a strong negative term indicating a complete failure or disaster.\n\nPutting it all together, the user is expressing dissatisfaction with both the shipping time and the packaging quality, culminating in a fiasco.

There's no positive language here, just strong negatives. Even though there's a comparison to a store product, the overall sentiment is very negative. \n\nI should check if there's any neutral elements, but \"hiç kullanışlı değil\" is a clear indicator of negativity.

The word \"beğendim\" is clearly positive. Even though \"kalıcı\" might have a neutral or slightly negative connotation depending on context, in this case, the user is stating that they like the product despite the lasting smell. \n\nSo the overall sentiment here is positive because the person explicitly says they liked it.

The phrase doesn't have strong positive or negative words. It's more of a neutral statement. The user might be saying that a situation is manageable, which isn't overly positive or negative.

The task is to label it as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The user mentions \"Üstü bol kısa bir yıkama da bir tarafı uzun bir tarafı kısa hale geldi\" which translates to something like \"After a short wash, one side became long and the other short.\" Then they say \"altı üstüne göre çok dar geldiği gibi deneyip yıkamamış olsaydım geri iade ederdim\" meaning \"If I hadn't washed it according to the instructions, I would have returned it.\"\n\nLooking for keywords that indicate sentiment. Words like \"yıkama\" (wash), \"dar\" (tight/narrow), and \"geri iade ederdim\" (would have returned) stand out. The user is talking about a product (maybe clothing?) that didn't fit well after washing, leading to consideration of returning it. This sounds negative because the outcome wasn't satisfactory.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if there's any positive aspect. The first part mentions \"üçü bol\" (loose?), but then the result is uneven lengths and tightness. The overall experience seems frustrating, leading to a possible return. That leans towards NEGATIVE.\n\nNo positive words here. The neutral label would be for indifferent or factual statements without strong emotions.

But then they say \"ancak ten renginizi iki ton koyulaştırıyor\" which means \"but it makes your skin tone two shades darker.\" That's a negative point.\n\nSo there's both a positive and a negative aspect here. The user is pointing out a benefit (color corrector) but also a drawback (darkening the skin tone). Since the review has both, maybe it's neutral? But I need to check if one part outweighs the other. However, in sentiment analysis, if there are both positive and negative elements without a clear dominant sentiment, it might be considered NEUTRAL. Alternatively, sometimes mixed sentiments can be tricky. But according to the rules given, examples like \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (Price-wise okay) is neutral.

Then \"verilmi\" might be a typo for \"verilmemiş\" (not given) or \"verilmiş\" (given), but in context, it's probably \"verilmi\" as in \"given.\" The phrase \"birdaha alacam\" means \"I will buy again,\" which is positive.

Usually, if something is simple, people might find it positive, but here the person is not recommending it. Maybe they mean that despite being simple, there's a negative aspect. Or perhaps they're using \"basit\" in a way that implies it's too basic or lacking in quality. The overall sentiment here is negative because they are advising against it. So even though part of the sentence mentions something positive (simple), the recommendation not to use it makes the overall sentiment negative.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Then \"indirimdeyken aldım\" translates to \"bought it when it was on sale,\" which is neutral in terms of sentiment but shows a purchasing decision. The part about using it for under the eyes is a specific use case, still neutral. Finally, \"mükemmel\" means \"perfect,\" which is clearly positive.\n\nSo the user is expressing satisfaction with the product, highlighting its quality and effectiveness.

So, it's saying that whatever is being referred to is better than others, which could be a positive statement. But wait, sometimes comparisons can be tricky. For example, if someone says \"Better than others,\" it might depend on the context. If they're talking about a product being better than competitors, that's positive. But if it's in a negative context, like \"better than others but still bad,\" then it could be neutral or negative.\n\nBut in this case, the sentence is straightforward: \"Diğerlerine göre daha iyi.\" There's no additional context indicating negativity. The key words here are \"daha iyi\" which is clearly positive. Even though it's a comparison, the sentiment is still positive because it's stating that something is better than others. So the label should be POSITIVE.\n\nWait, but sometimes people might use such phrases in a neutral way, like just stating a fact without strong emotion.

The phrase \"hepsi bir arada\" might be neutral on its own, but in context, it's reinforcing that all the good aspects are combined here. The emojis further support a positive sentiment.\n\nI should check if there's any negative connotation.

This could introduce some uncertainty.\n\nBut wait, the user might be talking about a product or service. They're saying it looks good now, but they can't tell the full impact yet. The positive part is there, but the second part is more neutral because they're uncertain. However, since the overall tone isn't negative, maybe it's still positive with some uncertainty. But according to the rules, I have to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nThe key here is that the user hasn't expressed any dissatisfaction. They are cautiously optimistic but not entirely sure. Since there's no explicit negative language, and the main sentiment is positive (\"güzel görünüyor\"), even with uncertainty, it might still be considered POSITIVE. However, some might argue that the uncertainty makes it NEUTRAL. But in the examples given, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral, which translates to \"Okay for the price,\" which is a balanced view. \n\nIn this case, the user is not entirely negative but also not fully positive because they can't see the effects yet. However, the initial statement is positive. Maybe it's leaning towards NEUTRAL because of the uncertainty. But I need to check if the presence of a positive statement overrides the uncertainty. Alternatively, maybe the overall sentiment is still positive despite the uncertainty.\n\nWait, looking at the examples again: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. That's a case where the user is satisfied but with reservations. Similarly, here, the user says it looks good but can't see the effects yet. So maybe that's similar to the example, which was neutral. Therefore, the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The words \"uygun\" and \"güzel\" are both positive adjectives. Even though \"uygun\" might be more neutral in some contexts, here it's paired with \"güzel,\" which is clearly positive.

Maybe they meant \"memnun kaldım,\" meaning \"I became satisfied.\"\n\nSo, putting it together: Initially, I bought it without checking the size, but I ended up being satisfied. The key words here are \"memnun kaldım\" which is positive. Even though there's a mention of not checking the size, the overall sentiment is positive because they're satisfied with the purchase despite that oversight.\n\nI should check if there's any negative connotation.

They mention one positive aspect: \"yüksek bel olması iyi\" (the high waist is good). However, they conclude with \"abartılacak bir pantolon değil\" (it's not an exaggerated pair of pants), which seems like a negative remark, implying it's not worth the hype.\n\nSo, even though there's a slight positive note about the waist, the overall sentiment is dominated by negative aspects: discomfort, dustiness, and disappointment.

Translating that to English, it's something like \"the smell, well, it's not that impressive. the durability isn't bad\". \n\nFirst, looking at the first part: \"etkileyici değil\" means \"not impressive\". That's a negative statement about the scent. But then there's \"kalıcılığı fena değil\", which translates to \"durability isn't bad\". \"Fena değil\" is a bit tricky. In Turkish, \"fena\" means bad, so \"fena değil\" is like \"not bad\" or \"okay\". So they're saying the durability is okay.\n\nNow, combining both parts. The user is pointing out that the smell isn't impressive (negative), but the durability is at least acceptable (neutral). However, since there's a mix of negative and neutral aspects, how do I categorize this? The instructions say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. \n\nThe main sentiment here seems to be more on the negative side because they're criticizing the smell, which might be a key factor. But the durability part is neutral. However, in such cases where there's a mix, but one aspect is clearly negative and another is neutral, maybe the overall sentiment leans towards negative. Alternatively, if the neutral part balances it out, maybe it's neutral. \n\nBut looking at examples given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled NEUTRAL. That's similar to this case where there's a mix but no strong positive or negative. However, in this text, there's a clear negative comment (\"etkileyici değil\") and a neutral one. But the user might be expressing dissatisfaction with the smell but some acceptance of durability. \n\nWait, \"fena değil\" can sometimes be used as a mild positive. Like, if someone says \"fena değil\", they might mean it's okay, not bad. So maybe the durability part is slightly positive? But in the example given by the user, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. So perhaps here, since there's both negative and neutral elements, but no strong positive, the overall label would be NEUTRAL. \n\nAlternatively, if the main point is the negative comment about the smell, maybe it's NEGATIVE. But I need to check the rules again. The user said that if there's a mix, how to handle. Since the example with \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral, which is a mix of positive and neutral? Wait, no, \"okey\" is neutral. So maybe in this case, since one part is negative and another is neutral, it's still considered NEUTRAL. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Another way to look at it: the user is pointing out a flaw (smell) but also noting that durability isn't bad. However, the overall sentiment might be more negative because they're highlighting a negative aspect. But maybe the presence of a neutral comment makes it NEUTRAL. \n\nHmm. In some cases, if there's both positive and negative, it's neutral. Here, one is negative, one is neutral. So perhaps the label should be NEGATIVE because the main sentiment is negative. Or maybe NEUTRAL because there's no strong positive or negative overall. \n\nI think in this case, since the user mentions a negative aspect (smell) and a neutral one (durability), but no positive aspects, it might lean towards NEGATIVE. However, if the instructions consider mixed sentiments as neutral unless there's a clear dominant sentiment, then maybe NEUTRAL. But I need to check the examples again. \n\nIn the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled NEUTRAL. That's a neutral statement. So in this case, since there's both negative and neutral elements, but no positive, perhaps it's still NEGATIVE because the main point is the criticism of the smell. But I'm not 100% certain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of \"fena değil\" (not bad) for durability could be considered a slight positive, making the overall sentiment NEUTRAL. However, since the user didn't mention anything positive about the product, just a negative and a neutral comment, it's tricky. \n\nI think the safest bet here is to label it as NEGATIVE because the main point of criticism (smell) is more impactful than the neutral comment on durability. But I'm not entirely sure. However, according to standard sentiment analysis practices, if there's a mix but one aspect is clearly negative and another is neutral, the overall might still be considered negative. Alternatively, it could be neutral if the user is just stating facts without strong emotions. \n\nWait, \"etkileyici değil\" is a clear negative statement. The other part is neutral. So maybe the label should be NEGATIVE because there's an explicit negative sentiment expressed.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The use of \"!!\" at the end might indicate frustration or surprise.

But here, the double exclamation points might lean towards a negative sentiment. However, I should also consider cultural context. In some cultures, exclamation marks are used more freely without necessarily indicating negativity.\n\nBut according to standard sentiment analysis rules, if there's an issue with delivery not meeting expectations, it's typically considered negative.

If it's describing an object, like a dress or a car, being very red might be positive if they like the color. However, without context, it's hard to tell. \n\nBut wait, sometimes in Turkish, colors can be used metaphorically. For example, \"kırmızı\" can also mean angry or embarrassed. So if someone says \"Çok kırmızı,\" they might be expressing that they're very angry or embarrassed.

Since there's no clear positive or negative sentiment in the phrase itself, and without additional context, the safest bet is NEUTRAL.

The use of \"maalesef\" and the mention of returning the item clearly point towards a negative experience. There's no positive language here, just disappointment and dissatisfaction. Even though there's a neutral action (returning), the sentiment behind it is negative.\n\nSo, the correct label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

But then they mention that after using it a few times, they haven't noticed any change in their hair. That part sounds negative because they're disappointed with the results. However, the overall sentiment might be neutral since there's both a positive and a negative aspect. The user isn't overly negative or positive; they're just stating their experience without strong emotions.\n\nWait, but maybe the main point is that despite the good smell, the product didn't work as expected. That could lean more towards negative. But the user hasn't used it enough times yet, so maybe they're still waiting to see results. The use of \"henüz\" (yet) suggests they might be hopeful or just starting out. \n\nHmm, but in sentiment analysis, we usually look at the overall tone. The positive comment is about the scent, and the negative part is about effectiveness. Since both are present, it's a mix. However, the user hasn't expressed strong dissatisfaction, just a lack of noticeable effect.

The phrase \"kurtaran\" means \"saved\" or \"rescued,\" which is positive. However, the context might be important. If someone's hair was in a bad situation and something saved it, that's positive. But maybe there's an underlying negative situation? For example, if the person had a problem with their hair and this product fixed it, then it's positive. But without more context, I have to go by the words used.\n\nThe sentence structure is a bit ambiguous. \"Tek kurtaran şey\" implies that whatever the subject is, it was the only thing that saved the hair. The user might be referring to a product or a method. Since the verb \"kurtarmak\" is positive, and there's no negative words here, the sentiment should be positive. However, sometimes in Turkish, depending on context, but without more information, I have to rely on the explicit words.\n\nSo, the label would be POSITIVE because the action of saving something is a positive outcome.

The text is: \"Ürün güzel etkili ancak reklamı yapıldıkça fiyatının artması üstüne özel fiyat diye lanse edilmesi doğru değil\". \n\nFirst, I'll break it down.

However, the second part uses \"ancak\" (but), which signals a contrast. The user is complaining about the price increasing as more advertising is done and the introduction of special prices being incorrect.\n\nSo there's a mix of positive and negative elements. But in sentiment analysis, even if there are positive parts, the overall tone here seems to be critical towards the pricing strategy. The main complaint is about the pricing practices, which outweighs the initial positive comments about the product's effectiveness. \n\nThe user might be satisfied with the product itself but unhappy with how the company handles pricing. However, since the instruction is to label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL, I need to determine the dominant sentiment. The negative part here is more about the business practices rather than the product quality. But the overall sentiment expressed by the user is dissatisfaction with the pricing strategy, which leans towards negative.\n\nWait, but maybe it's neutral? Because they acknowledge the product is good but have a complaint. However, in many sentiment analysis models, mixed sentiments can be tricky. The presence of \"doğru değil\" (not right) at the end is a strong negative indicator. Even though there are positive adjectives, the overall message is critical of the company's actions.

But the overall sentiment depends on which part is stronger. The positives are about the scent and cleanliness, while the negative is about effectiveness. Since they mention a drawback but still acknowledge the positives, maybe it's neutral? Or maybe slightly negative because the main function (masking odor) isn't effective.

The user wrote, \"Temizleme jeli güzel ama diğerinin bir faydasını görmedim.\" Translating that to English: \"The cleaning gel is nice but I didn't see any benefit from the other one.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The sentence has two parts connected by \"ama\" which means \"but.\" The first part is positive (\"güzel\" meaning nice or good). The second part is negative because the user says they didn't see any benefit from the other product.\n\nNow, the challenge is determining whether the overall sentiment is more positive, negative, or neutral. Since there's a contrast between the two parts, but both are present. However, in sentiment analysis, when there's a contradiction, sometimes it's considered neutral because the positive and negative aspects cancel each other out. But I need to check if one part outweighs the other.\n\nThe first part is about the cleaning gel being good, which is a positive point. The second part is about not seeing any benefit from another product, which is negative. However, the user might be comparing two products here. If they're talking about two different products, then the sentiment towards each could be separate. But since it's one sentence, maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because there's both a positive and a negative aspect mentioned without clear emphasis on either.\n\nAlternatively, if the context is that the user is talking about two aspects of the same product, but that doesn't seem to fit here. The structure \"Temizleme jeli güzel ama diğerinin...\" suggests two different items: the cleaning gel (temizleme jeli) and another product (\"diğerinin\"). So they're comparing two products. In that case, the user is saying one is good but the other isn't beneficial. \n\nBut for sentiment analysis of the entire sentence, since both positive and negative sentiments are present without clear dominance, it might be considered neutral. However, sometimes in such cases, if there's a contrast, the overall sentiment could lean towards negative because the second part introduces a criticism. But I need to check standard practices.\n\nIn many sentiment analysis models, when there's a mix of positive and negative sentiments without clear emphasis, it's often labeled as neutral.

However, the instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL based on the dominant sentiment.\n\nBut wait, the example given for \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was NEUTRAL. In this case, there are both positive and negative elements. But does the negative part outweigh the positive? The user might be satisfied with the quality but disappointed with the size. However, since the main complaint is about the size being much smaller than expected, which could affect overall satisfaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a neutral because there are both positives and negatives. But I need to check the rules again.\n\nThe instructions say to use POSITIVE if the sentiment is positive, NEGATIVE if negative, and NEUTRAL otherwise. The example where there was a mix but the main point was negative would be NEGATIVE. However, in this case, the user mentions both good aspects and a negative one. But since the negative part is a significant drawback (size), maybe it's more negative. Alternatively, if the positives and negatives balance out, it could be neutral.\n\nBut looking at the examples again: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was NEUTRAL because it's a balanced statement. Here, the user has both positive and negative points but the negative is a specific issue. However, since the product's size being much smaller than expected might be a major point of dissatisfaction, even though other aspects are good. But I'm not sure if that's enough to label as NEGATIVE overall.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's NEUTRAL because there are both positive and negative elements without one clearly dominating. The user is expressing some satisfaction but also disappointment. So the overall sentiment might be neutral.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user wrote, \"Sen muhteşem bir maskarasın.\" Translating that to English, it's \"You are a magnificent maskar.\" Wait, \"maskara\" in Turkish is \"mascara,\" the eyeliner product. But here, the structure is \"muhteşem bir maskarasın,\" which literally means \"you are a magnificent mascara.\" That doesn't make much sense in context. Maybe it's a typo or a play on words.\n\nWait, could \"maskara\" be a name here? If someone's named Maskara, then saying they're magnificent would be positive. But without knowing the context, it's tricky. However, the word \"muhteşem\" is definitely positive, meaning excellent or magnificent. The rest of the sentence is a bit confusing because \"bir maskarasın\" would mean \"you are a mascara,\" which seems odd unless it's a nickname or a specific reference.\n\nBut considering common usage, if someone is being called a \"maskara,\" that could be an insult in some contexts, but here it's paired with \"muhteşem,\" which is positive. So the overall sentiment is likely positive despite the unusual phrasing. The user might be using a metaphor or there's a typo. Either way, the key words are \"muhteşem\" and \"maskarasın.\" Since \"muhteşem\" is strongly positive, I'll go with POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

So that's a positive point. Then they mention the only bad part is that it's not long-lasting; they need to refresh it every one or two hours. The negative aspect here is the lack of longevity.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The user starts with a positive note about the fragrance being fresh and light, which they liked. However, they also point out a significant downside: the scent doesn't last long. This is a clear negative point. Even though there's a positive aspect, the mention of a drawback might tip the balance towards negative. But I should check if the user's overall sentiment leans more on one side.\n\nIn some cases, if the positive and negative aspects are balanced, it could be neutral. However, here the user explicitly states that the only bad part is the longevity issue. The fact that they mention a single negative point in an otherwise positive context might still make the overall sentiment negative because the drawback is a major inconvenience. Alternatively, if the user had mixed feelings without a clear emphasis, it might be neutral.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, translating the Turkish part. \"Kullanımdan sonra\" means \"after use\" or \"after using\". \"Kopuyor\" translates to \"breaking\" or \"coming off\". So the sentence is saying something like \"After two uses, it breaks\" or \"It comes off after two uses\".\n\nNow, considering the context. If a product breaks after only two uses, that's definitely a negative experience. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the durability of the product. There's no positive language here, just stating a problem. Even though there's a number mentioned (2), it's highlighting the short lifespan of the item, which is a negative point.\n\nI should check if there's any ambiguity. Maybe \"kopuyor\" could have different meanings? But in this context, it's likely referring to the product breaking or falling apart. No positive words are present, so the sentiment is clearly negative.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Then there's an emoji 🤷‍♂️, which is the shrug emoji, often used to express indifference or uncertainty. The sentence ends with \"değil\", meaning \"not\".\n\nPutting it together, the user is saying something like \"It doesn't seem as it appeared\" or \"Not as it seems\". The shrug emoji adds a layer of ambiguity or hesitation. The use of \"değil\" at the end negates the initial statement. \n\nNow, considering the sentiment labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL.

The task is to label it as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The user starts by saying \"Şampuan harika kokusu falan çok hoş\" which translates to something like \"The shampoo has a great smell and is very nice.\" That's clearly positive. But then they mention \"kargo 20 gün sonra geldi\" meaning \"the shipment arrived after 20 days,\" which is negative because it's a long wait. Next, \"iyi paketlenmemişti kartona sarılmış ama şampuanın kapağı bantlansaymış ve dökülmüştü kargolanması beğenmedim\" translates to \"it wasn't packed well, wrapped in cardboard, but the shampoo cap was taped and spilled. I didn't like how it was shipped.\" That's more negative points about packaging and shipping.\n\nSo there are both positive and negative aspects here. The product itself is liked for its smell, but the shipping experience is bad. However, the instructions say to consider the overall sentiment. Since the user mentions multiple negative aspects (delayed shipment, poor packaging, spilled product) which seem to be significant issues, even though they liked the scent, the overall experience might lean more towards negative. But I need to check if the negatives outweigh the positives here. The positive part is about the product's quality, while the negatives are about delivery and packaging. Depending on the context of the analysis (product vs service), but since the user is talking about their overall experience with the purchase, including shipping, the negatives might make the overall sentiment negative. However, sometimes in such cases, if the product itself is good but the service isn't, it could be neutral. But the user explicitly says \"kargolanması beğenmedim\" which means they didn't like the shipping, so that's a strong negative point.

But then they say \"ama bu kaliteye bu fiyat çok\" meaning \"but for this quality, the price is too much.\" Here, the user is pointing out that the price is not justified given the quality, which is negative. The last part \".yanisi değmiyor\" seems like a typo or shorthand for \"yani değer miyor,\" which means \"it's not worth it.\" That definitely adds a negative sentiment.\n\nSo even though there's an initial positive note (\"not bad\"), the overall sentiment is dominated by the criticism about the price not matching the quality.

However, the second part \"ancak denemeye devam\" means \"but I'll keep trying,\" which shows a positive intention or perseverance.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment analysis rules.

But according to the guidelines, if there's a mix of sentiments, how should it be handled? The example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey,\" which is more of an indifferent statement.\n\nIn this case, the user is not entirely negative or positive. They acknowledge that something didn't work well but are still continuing. This might lean towards neutral because there's no strong positive or negative sentiment dominating.

The user is describing a negative experience with a product or treatment that led to these issues.\n\nLooking at the example given, if someone says \"Zehirlendim.\" (I got poisoned), it's labeled as NEGATIVE.

The word \"küöük\" might be a typo for \"kötü\" (bad) or \"küçük\" (small). Assuming it's \"kötü\", the sentence would mean \"don't buy a lot of bad products, waste money\".

However, the presence of both negative and neutral elements might lean towards NEUTRAL. But I need to check if the overall sentiment is more negative or neutral.\n\nThe key here is that the user isn't expressing a strong negative emotion; they're just stating it's not very useful but still using it. The uncertainty (\"bakalım\") adds a neutral aspect. So, maybe NEUTRAL is appropriate here. However, some might argue that the initial statement is negative enough to label as NEGATIVE.

I need to determine the sentiment here.\n\nFirst, the word \"düzeltildi\" is a past tense verb indicating that something was corrected or fixed. In many contexts, this could be positive because it suggests a problem was resolved. However, sometimes depending on the situation, if the correction was not done properly or if there's an underlying issue, it might have a negative connotation. But in most cases, when someone says something was fixed, they're implying that the issue is resolved, which is a positive outcome.\n\nLooking at the examples given: \"Yemek harikaydı\" (The food was amazing) is positive, \"Zehirlendim\" (I got poisoned) is negative, and \"Fiyatına göre okey\" (Okay for the price) is neutral. The word \"düzeltildi\" doesn't have a clear positive or negative indicator like those examples. However, since it's about a problem being resolved, it leans towards positive. But wait, maybe in some contexts, if the correction was not satisfactory, but the user didn't specify any such context. \n\nThe rules say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there's no explicit negative word here, and \"düzeltildi\" is neutral in itself, but often implies a positive outcome. However, without more context, it might be safer to label it as NEUTRAL because the sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative. Wait, but the example with \"Fiyatına göre okey\" was neutral. So maybe if the text is just stating a fact without any emotional language, it's neutral. But \"düzeltildi\" could be seen as a positive action. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, in some cases, if something was fixed but there's an implication that it shouldn't have needed fixing, but again, without context, it's hard to tell. The safest bet here is NEUTRAL because the text doesn't express clear positive or negative emotions. It's just stating a fact that something was corrected.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the user's comment: \"Dandik almayın\". First, I need to understand the Turkish words here. \"Dandik\" is a slang term that can be offensive, similar to \"dumb\" or \"stupid\" in English. The phrase \"almayın\" translates to \"don't take\" or \"don't buy\". So putting it together, the user is advising others not to take something from someone who is described as \"dandik\".\n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The use of \"dandik\" is negative, and the advice to not take something implies a warning against associating with or supporting such a person. This carries a negative connotation. However, I should check if there's any context where this might be neutral. But given the directness of the language and the offensive term used, it's more likely negative. The user is expressing disapproval towards someone being \"dandik\" and advising others against taking from them, which is a negative sentiment.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The key word here is \"harika,\" which is clearly positive. Even though it's a short phrase, the presence of \"harika\" strongly indicates a positive sentiment. There's no negative language or neutral terms that might dilute the sentiment.

Words like \"düşünmeden alın\" (buy without thinking) suggest a strong recommendation. \"Nem bombası\" is a positive term, implying something beneficial. \"Sağlıklı period\" could be a play on words, maybe referring to both skin health and menstrual health, but in Turkish, \"period\" can sometimes be used informatively. The overall tone seems encouraging and positive towards the product.\n\nAre there any negative words? The text mentions that if using other creams makes the skin oilier, this product is better.

Then \"cildi pamuk giibi yapıyor\" – \"makes the skin like cotton,\" which is a good description, implying softness and comfort.

The text is: \"Kumaş yakıcı bir kumaş naylonumsu dışarıda güneşte giymek çok zor ev elbisesi olarak cici\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context and the emotions expressed here. Let's break it down word by word.\n\n\"Kumaş yakıcı bir kumaş\" – \"yakıcı\" means burning or scorching, which is negative. But then \"naylonumsu\" refers to something like nylon, which might be a material. The next part: \"dışarıda güneşte giymek çok zor\" translates to wearing it in the sun being very difficult, which sounds negative. However, \"ev elbisesi olarak cici\" means as a home dress, it's cute (\"cici\" is endearing). \n\nSo there's a mix of negative and positive aspects. The user is complaining about the fabric being uncomfortable (yakıcı, naylonumsu) and difficult to wear in the sun, but then mentions that as a home dress, it's cute. \n\nIn sentiment analysis, if there are both positive and negative elements, but no clear dominance, it might be neutral. However, the main complaints about discomfort could tip it towards negative. But the positive note at the end might balance it. \n\nBut looking at the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. So if there's a mix of positive and negative without clear dominance, it's neutral. Here, the user points out flaws but also a positive aspect. However, the overall sentiment seems more negative because the main issues (uncomfortable fabric, difficulty in wearing) are significant drawbacks, while the positive comment is a minor point. \n\nWait, but maybe \"cici\" is strong enough to make it neutral? Or does the negative aspects outweigh? It's tricky. In some cases, if there's both positive and negative, but no clear majority, it's neutral. However, sometimes the presence of any positive can make it neutral even with negatives. \n\nAlternatively, if the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's quality (fabric) but likes its cuteness as a home dress, maybe it's mixed. But according to the rules, we have to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. Since there are both positive and negative elements without clear dominance, the safest label here would be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

However, there's a part that says \"biraz sarı mor isterseniz çok tutun\" which translates to something like \"if you want a bit of yellow purple, hold on a lot.\" The phrase \"çok tutun\" might be a typo or slang.

The user is pointing out that the product doesn't address black spots, which might be a drawback.\n\nNow, considering the overall sentiment. The review has both positive and negative aspects. But in sentiment analysis, if there are mixed opinions, it's usually labeled as NEUTRAL because the positives and negatives balance each other out. However, sometimes the dominant aspect determines the label. Here, the user is highlighting two benefits but also a limitation. Since the product doesn't address black spots, which might be an important feature for some users, this could tilt the sentiment towards NEGATIVE. But on the other hand, the positive aspects are also significant.\n\nWait, but in many cases, if there's both positive and negative feedback without clear dominance, NEUTRAL is appropriate. The user isn't overly negative or positive; they're stating facts about the product's effects. So maybe NEUTRAL is the right choice here.

The first sentence says \"inanılmaz uygun\" which translates to \"unbelievably suitable\" or \"incredibly appropriate.\" That's a strong positive adjective.\n\nNext, \"Çoğu pede göre de yumuşak\" means \"also soft compared to most pads.\" Softness is a positive attribute here, especially for a product like a pad, so that's another positive point.\n\nThe last sentence is \"Kesinlikle kaçırmayın,\" which translates to \"Definitely don't miss out.\" This is a strong recommendation, indicating the user highly recommends the product. \n\nPutting it all together, all parts of the review are positive. There's no negative language or neutral statements. The user is enthusiastic about the product's suitability and softness, and strongly advises others to buy it.

The text is: \"Makinesi güzel ama ağdası iş görmez parcalanma yapıyor alacaksanız makinesi için alın derim kaş ve biyik için ideal\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user is talking about a machine (probably a hair dryer or similar appliance) and mentions that the motor is good but the cord doesn't work properly, causing damage. They advise buying it for the motor if you're considering purchasing, but it's ideal for eyebrows and beard.\n\nNow, breaking down the sentiment. The positive part is \"Makinesi güzel\" (the motor is good). However, there are negative aspects: \"ağdası iş görmez parcalanma yapıyor\" (the cord doesn't work and causes damage). The user also gives a recommendation but points out flaws. \n\nThe overall sentiment seems mixed, but the presence of significant negative aspects about the product's functionality might tip it towards negative. However, there's a neutral part where they mention it's ideal for certain uses.

First, I need to understand what this phrase means in Turkish. \"İdare etmek\" usually translates to \"to manage\" or \"to cope with.\" So \"İdare eder\" would be something like \"It's manageable\" or \"It can be handled.\"\n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The phrase doesn't have strong positive or negative words. It's more of a neutral statement. The person is saying that something is manageable, which isn't overly positive but also not negative. It's a matter-of-fact observation.\n\nLooking at the examples given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled NEUTRAL. That translates to \"It's okay for the price,\" which is similar in tone. So \"İdare eder\" seems to fit the same category. There's no enthusiasm or strong negative emotion here. It's just stating a fact that it can be managed.\n\nI should make sure there are no hidden nuances. Maybe in some contexts, \"idare etmek\" could have a slightly positive connotation, but generally, it's neutral. The user's instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there's no clear positive or negative sentiment, NEUTRAL is the right choice here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

That's a negative statement.\n\nNext sentence: \"Faydası da yok.\" \"Faydası\" is \"benefit\" or \"use,\" and \"yok\" means \"no.\" So they're stating there's no benefit, which is another negative point.\n\nThird part: \"Tavsiye etmiyorum.\" That translates to \"I don't recommend it.\" This is a strong negative statement, indicating dissatisfaction.\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"çok kötü,\" \"yok,\" and \"tavsiye etmiyorum\" are all strongly negative. There's no positive language here. The user is clearly expressing dissatisfaction with both the smell and the product's effectiveness. \n\nThe rules mention that if there's a mix of sentiments, but in this case, all parts are consistently negative.

That's usually a negative experience. People don't typically want a burning feeling after using a product. Even though the user didn't use strong negative language like \"horrible\" or \"terrible,\" the presence of a physical discomfort is a clear indicator of a negative sentiment. \n\nI should check if there's any context that might make this neutral, but the sentence directly states an adverse effect.

The user might be pointing out that the product is small, which could be a negative if they expected something bigger, but maybe it's just stating a fact.\n\nNext part: \"her dudak balmı gibi bence\". \"Her dudak balmı\" is \"every lip balm\", and \"bence\" means \"in my opinion\".

The user might be reviewing a product or service, highlighting its beauty and quality. Since all the adjectives used are positive, the label should be POSITIVE.

First, I need to understand what this phrase means in Turkish.\n\n\"Anlık\" translates to \"instant\" or \"immediate.\" \"Nem\" is \"moisture,\" and \"veriyor\" is \"providing\" or \"giving.\" So the whole phrase could be something like \"provides instant moisture.\" \n\nNow, considering the context, if a product is providing instant moisture, that's usually a positive attribute. People generally prefer products that work quickly and effectively. However, I should check if there's any negative connotation here. Words like \"anlık\" might sometimes imply something temporary, but in skincare or similar contexts, it's often seen as a benefit.\n\nLooking at the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled NEUTRAL. That's because it's a neutral statement about price. In this case, \"anlık nem veriyor\" is more of a positive feature unless there's an implied downside. But since the phrase itself doesn't have negative words, and the action (providing moisture) is positive, I think the label should be POSITIVE.\n\nI need to make sure there are no hidden negatives. Maybe in some contexts, but without additional information, the default is positive. So the correct label here is POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Since the user is clearly expressing dissatisfaction with the smell, this should be negative. There's no ambiguity here. The word \"berbat\" is a clear indicator of a negative feeling. I don't see any neutral terms or positive words in the sentence. \n\nI need to make sure there are no other possible interpretations. Maybe \"berbat\" could have a different context, but in this case, it's straightforward.

They praise it for being incredibly moisturizing and having a good texture. However, they also mention that their friend bought the colored version but wasn't happy with the color, saying it doesn't add enough color.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The user starts with positive feedback about the product they're using. They highlight the moisturizing effect and texture, which are strong positives. Then there's a part about their friend's experience with the colored version. The friend wasn't satisfied because the color wasn't sufficient. But here's the thing: the user is talking about their own experience with the colorless version and their friend's experience with the colored one. \n\nSo, the main subject here is the colorless product, which the user is happy with. The negative part is about a different product (the colored version) that the friend used. Since the review is focused on the colorless version, the positive aspects dominate. However, I need to check if the mention of the friend's dissatisfaction could influence the sentiment towards the colorless version. But since the user is happy with their own product and the friend's issue is about a different variant, it might not affect the overall sentiment of the colorless product.\n\nWait, but maybe the user is comparing both versions? The user says they use the colorless one and are satisfied, then mentions the colored one was bought for a friend who wasn't happy. So the negative part is about the colored version, which isn't the same as the colorless one. Therefore, the sentiment towards the colorless product remains positive. \n\nBut I should also consider if there's any ambiguity. The user might be implying that the colored version doesn't perform well in terms of color, but since they're happy with their own choice (colorless), the overall sentiment is still positive. There's no direct negative feedback about the colorless product itself. The friend's experience is a separate point. \n\nSo, the label should be POSITIVE because the user is satisfied with the product they use and the negatives are about a different variant.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The key words are \"sertleştiriyor\" (stiffens), \"ağırlaştırıyor\" (makes heavy), \"yetersiz nemlendirme etkisini görmedim\" (didn't see sufficient moisturizing effect), and \"tavsiye etmiyorum\" (I don't recommend). All these are negative terms. The user is clearly dissatisfied with both products. There's no positive language here, so the sentiment should be negative.

They mention not finding a solution. The context could be about a product issue, maybe a cosmetic problem with the lemon's color. The user is expressing dissatisfaction because they couldn't find a way to fix it. \n\nLooking at the sentiment tags: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL.

First, I need to understand the content of the text.\n\nThe review starts with \"Kapatıcılık arıyorsanız assssla alınmaması gereken bir ürün\" which translates to something like \"If you're looking for coverage, this is a product that should not be bought.\" That sounds negative. But then it says \"ama doğal ve aydınlık bir görünüm istiyorsanız alınabilir\" meaning \"but if you want a natural and bright look, it can be purchased.\" So there's a positive aspect here. However, the next part is \"ama beyaz tenliler için 01 numarası bile aydınlatmıyor\" which translates to \"but even size 01 doesn't illuminate for fair-skinned people.\" That seems negative again.\n\nSo the review has mixed sentiments. The user mentions both positive and negative points. But according to the rules, I need to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there are both positive and negative elements but no clear dominance, maybe it's neutral? Wait, but the initial part is a strong negative statement about not buying if you want coverage. Then a conditional positive for those wanting natural look, but another negative about illumination for fair skin. It's conflicting. However, in such cases where there are both positive and negative aspects without a clear majority, NEUTRAL might be appropriate. But sometimes, the overall sentiment can lean based on context. Let me check again.\n\nThe user starts with a strong negative recommendation against buying for coverage. Then offers a conditional positive for natural look but immediately follows up with another negative about illumination. The negatives seem more impactful here because they are direct criticisms of the product's effectiveness. The positive is conditional and maybe not as strong. So perhaps NEGATIVE? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since there are both positive and negative points, NEUTRAL could be correct. However, in some sentiment analysis frameworks, mixed sentiments might still lean towards negative if the negatives are more prominent. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user says \"alınabilir\" (can be purchased) but then immediately contradicts with another negative point. The overall tone seems to be cautionary, suggesting it's not suitable for certain uses despite some benefits. So maybe NEGATIVE is the right label here because the main recommendation is against purchasing unless specific conditions are met, and there's a significant drawback mentioned. Alternatively, if the positive and negative are balanced, NEUTRAL. But I think in this case, the negatives outweigh the positives, leading to NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Then \"çok yağlı\" means \"very greasy,\" which is a negative description about the food. The second part says \"fondotenin akmasına sebep oluyor,\" which translates to \"causes the fondue to run.\" Fondue is a type of melted cheese, and if it's running, that might be a problem for the person eating it, indicating dissatisfaction.\n\nPutting it all together, the user is expressing disappointment with the food being too greasy and causing the fondue to run.

Let me try to parse it. Maybe it's supposed to be \"Fiyatına göre küçük işlevi büyük Sürdüğümde insanlar kendi cildim olduğunu bb krem sürdüğümü anlamıyorlar bile o kadar harika\".

Then \"insanlar kendi cildim olduğunu bb krem sürdüğümü anlamıyorlar bile o kadar harika\". It seems like people don't realize they're applying the cream to their own skin and it's so amazing. \n\nThe sentiment here is a bit tricky.

They mention it's lighter by one or two tones. \n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The user isn't explicitly happy or angry. They're stating a fact about the product not matching the photo. This could be a negative point because the product doesn't match expectations, but maybe they're just informing rather than complaining.

But sometimes, if the user is just stating an observation without expressing dissatisfaction, it might be neutral.\n\nBut wait, the original examples had \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which was neutral. That was about price being okay. Here, the user is pointing out a difference in color. If they're not happy with it, that's negative. But if they're just stating a fact without emotion, maybe neutral. However, in customer feedback contexts, such observations are often considered negative because they indicate a problem with the product representation.\n\nBut I need to be careful. The user didn't use any strong negative words like \"çok kötü\" or \"zehirlendim\". They just mentioned the color is different. So maybe it's neutral. However, in some contexts, even pointing out discrepancies can be seen as negative feedback. But according to the rules, I should look at the content and decide based on the sentiment expressed.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is just informing without expressing a positive or negative feeling, then it's neutral. For example, \"The product arrived late.\" That's neutral unless there's an emotional word. Here, the sentence is factual but might imply dissatisfaction. But maybe not necessarily. It depends on the context of the platform. If this is a review, then pointing out a discrepancy could be negative. However, if it's just a statement without any judgment, it's neutral.\n\nHmm.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The user is talking about a product, specifically a lipstick from Golden Rose. They mention \"en favori\" which means \"favorite,\" and \"en güzel\" meaning \"most beautiful.\" Both of these are strong positive adjectives. Then they mention the shade number 16, which is probably a specific color. The heart symbol ♡ at the end also adds a positive emotion.\n\nThere's no negative language here. The user is expressing satisfaction with the product, highlighting it as their favorite and most beautiful. Even though there's no explicit praise beyond the adjectives used, the context of favoring a product and using affectionate symbols indicates a positive sentiment.\n\nI should check if there's any ambiguity. The words \"en favori\" and \"en güzel\" are clearly positive. The heart symbol reinforces that. No negative words or neutral statements.

However, they do say \"ÜRÜN KALİTELİ OLMASINA RAĞMEN\" which is \"despite the product being high quality.\" So they acknowledge the product's quality, but the issues with packaging and the wrinkled product are negatives.\n\nThe user is expressing dissatisfaction with the packaging and the condition of the product, even though they admit the product itself is good.

Since the phrase expresses dissatisfaction, the sentiment should be negative. I need to make sure there are no neutral words here.

The phrase itself is neutral in terms of positive or negative emotions. It's stating a fact about the product's availability or accessibility. There's no explicit praise or criticism here. Words like \"gereken\" (should be) indicate a necessity, but not a positive or negative feeling. \n\nLooking at the example given, when the text was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (Okay for the price), it was labeled as NEUTRAL. Similarly, this sentence doesn't express satisfaction or dissatisfaction. It's more of a statement about the product's presence rather than an emotional response.\n\nI should check if there are any implicit sentiments. The phrase might imply that the product is essential, but without additional context like \"it's essential because it's so good\" or \"it's necessary despite being bad,\" it's hard to assign a positive or negative label. \n\nTherefore, the most appropriate label here is NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

But in this case, the negative aspects might make the overall sentiment more negative. Wait, but the user didn't explicitly say they're unhappy with the product overall. They just mentioned some issues but also a positive point. Maybe it's neutral because they're pointing out flaws but not strongly negative. Or maybe the positives and negatives balance each other out. Hmm. The instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. If there are both positive and negative elements without a clear dominant sentiment, NEUTRAL might be appropriate. But sometimes, if the negatives are more impactful, it could be NEGATIVE.

The next part is \"bence hassas ciltere göre değil\" – the user is saying that, in their opinion, it's not suitable for sensitive skin. Finally, \"biraz yakma yapıyor\" translates to \"it causes some burning.\" \n\nSo, the positive aspect is the price, but the negative aspects are the unsuitability for sensitive skin and causing a burning sensation.

However, the instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there are conflicting sentiments, maybe it's considered mixed. But according to the rules, I have to pick one. The examples don't cover mixed cases. Let me check the rules again. Rule 3 says that if there's a mix, perhaps the dominant sentiment should be chosen. However, in this case, both parts are equally weighted. The first part is positive, the second negative. But maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because it's a mix of positive and negative. Alternatively, since the user didn't like the fabric, which might be a more significant factor, but that's subjective.\n\nWait, looking at the examples again: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. So if there are both positive and negative aspects without a clear dominant one, maybe it's considered neutral. In this case, the user has a positive point (product arrived as expected) and a negative (didn't like the fabric). Since they're two separate points, perhaps the overall sentiment is neutral. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the negative part is more impactful, but that depends on context. The instruction doesn't specify how to handle mixed sentiments.

The user provided a Turkish text that needs to be categorized as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The user mentions two main points: the product provides excessive refreshment during summer months (\"Yaz aylarinda aşırı ferahlik sagliyor\"), but they didn't see a positive effect on their skin (\"cildimde olumlu etkisini goremedim\"). Then they mention that refrigerated natural rose water is more effective (\"Buzdolabinda bekletilen saf Gul suyu daha etkili\").\n\nSo, the first part is positive about the cooling effect. The second part is negative because the user didn't see benefits for their skin. However, the last sentence suggests an alternative product (refrigerated rose water) that's more effective. This might indicate a neutral stance overall since they're comparing two products and pointing out where one falls short but another works better.\n\nBut wait, the main subject here is the product being reviewed. The user is saying that despite the cooling effect, it didn't help their skin, which is a negative point. However, they also mention an alternative, which might be neutral because they're not directly criticizing the product but suggesting another option. But since the primary feedback about the product's effectiveness on the skin is negative, that might tip the scale to NEGATIVE. Alternatively, if the user is just comparing and not necessarily dissatisfied with the product itself, maybe NEUTRAL.\n\nHmm, tricky. The key is whether the overall sentiment is more negative or neutral. The user didn't like the effect on their skin (negative) but found another product better. However, the original product's effectiveness is questioned, leading to a negative sentiment. But since they also mention an alternative, maybe it's neutral because they're not outrightly saying the product is bad, just that it doesn't work for them and another does. \n\nI think in this case, the primary sentiment is negative towards the product's effect on the skin, even though there's a positive note about cooling. But since the user didn't see the desired effect (which might be the main purpose of the product), the overall sentiment leans negative. However, if the product's main function is cooling and not skincare, then maybe neutral. But the mention of \"cildimde olumlu etkisini goremedim\" suggests that the user expected a positive skin effect but didn't get it, which is negative.

The text is: \"Bir kez giyindim askilar koptu hemen 3 rengini almıştım hepsi öyle askilar çok kalitesiz\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user is talking about wearing something (probably clothing) and the zippers came off immediately. They mention buying three colors and all of them had the same issue, calling the quality very poor.\n\nNow, looking for keywords that indicate sentiment. Words like \"koptu\" (came off), \"kalitesiz\" (poor quality) are negative. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's durability and quality. There's no positive language here. Even though they mention buying three colors, it's in the context of all having the same problem, which reinforces the negative sentiment.\n\nSo the label should be NEGATIVE. I need to make sure there's no neutral or positive elements. The user is clearly upset about the product's quality and the fact that it broke after wearing it once.

Translating that to English, it's something like \"the scent and moisturizing are nice but the longevity is not enough\". \n\nFirst, I need to identify the positive, negative, or neutral aspects. The user starts by complimenting the scent and moisturizing properties, which are positive points. However, they then mention that the longevity (how long the fragrance lasts) is not sufficient, which is a negative point.\n\nNow, the challenge is determining whether the overall sentiment is more positive, negative, or neutral. The sentence has both positive and negative elements. But in such cases, the presence of a negative aspect can tip the balance. Even though there are positives, the user is pointing out a significant drawback. \n\nIn many sentiment analysis scenarios, if there's a mix but one part is critical (like longevity in a fragrance), it might be seen as more negative. However, sometimes if the positive aspects are strong enough, it could be neutral. But here, the negatives are about a key feature that's important for a product like perfume or skincare. \n\nSo, considering that the user mentions both good and bad points but the negative is about a crucial aspect, I think the overall sentiment leans towards negative. However, some might argue it's neutral because there are both positives and negatives. But in this case, since the negative part is a direct criticism of an important feature, I'll go with NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

But then they mention that it doesn't look good on dark hair and you need to lighten your hair first. That part is negative. So there's both positive and negative aspects.

The user wrote, \"Biraz abartıldığını düşünenlerdenim.\" Translating that to English, it means \"I'm someone who thinks it's a bit exaggerated.\" Now, I need to determine the sentiment here.\n\nFirst, the key words are \"biraz\" (a bit) and \"abartıldığını\" (exaggerated). The person is expressing that something is slightly overdone. But does that lean positive, negative, or neutral?\n\nWell, \"abartılmış\" usually has a negative connotation, implying something is overstated or not accurate. However, the use of \"biraz\" softens it, suggesting it's not extremely negative. The person isn't outright criticizing but pointing out an exaggeration. \n\nBut in sentiment analysis, even if it's softened, pointing out a flaw can still be seen as negative. However, since they're just stating their opinion without strong negative words, maybe neutral? Wait, but the original examples had \"fiyatına göre okey\" as neutral. That was more of an indifferent statement. Here, the user is expressing a specific opinion that something is exaggerated, which might lean slightly negative. But I need to check if the sentiment is clearly positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's neutral because they're just stating their perspective without strong emotional language. However, \"abartılmış\" can carry a negative tone. Hmm. The example given for neutral was \"fiyatına göre okey,\" which is more of an acceptance based on price. This case is different because it's pointing out a flaw, even if mildly. \n\nIn Turkish sentiment analysis, terms like \"abartılmış\" are often associated with negative sentiments unless context suggests otherwise. Since the user is indicating that something is exaggerated, which is a form of criticism, even if mild, it might be considered negative. However, without more context, it's tricky. But based on the rules provided and examples, maybe it's neutral because they're just stating their opinion without strong emotional words. Wait, but \"abartılmış\" is a negative term. \n\nLooking back at the examples: \"Zehirlendim.\" (I got poisoned) is clearly negative. \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. The current text is pointing out an exaggeration, which could be seen as a mild negative. However, since it's not strongly negative and just an opinion, maybe neutral? Or does the presence of \"abartılmış\" push it to negative?\n\nI think in this case, even though it's softened by \"biraz,\" the sentiment is still slightly negative because they're pointing out an exaggeration as a flaw. Therefore, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user's message doesn't have clear positive words, but neither does it have overtly negative ones. It's more about a neutral stance, perhaps acknowledging a situation without strong emotion. \n\nBut wait, sometimes \"eh\" can be used sarcastically or with mild frustration.

Then \"renkler güzel\" means the colors are nice. \"Fırçalar yumuşak\" translates to the brushes are soft.

The user starts with a positive statement but follows it with a negative one. However, in many cases, when there's a contrast like this, the dominant sentiment might depend on context. But since both parts are significant, maybe it's neutral? Wait, but the initial positive comment is strong. However, the presence of a negative aspect could tip it towards negative. Alternatively, if the product was mostly good but had one issue, maybe it's still positive with a caveat.\n\nBut according to standard sentiment analysis rules, when there's a mix of positive and negative sentiments without clear dominance, it might be considered neutral. But I need to check examples given earlier. For instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. That translates to \"Okay considering the price,\" which is a balanced view. Similarly, here, the user says something is very beautiful (positive) but has a color issue (negative). So it's a mix. However, in some cases, if the positive part is stronger, it might still be positive. But since there's a clear negative aspect mentioned, maybe it's neutral? Or perhaps negative because the main point of dissatisfaction is present.\n\nWait, but the user might be expressing that despite the color issue, they still found it beautiful. However, the presence of \"ama\" (but) often introduces a more significant point. In some contexts, if the negative part is a deal-breaker, it could make the overall sentiment negative. But without knowing the context of the product, it's hard to say. Since the instruction says to use the labels POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, and considering that there are both positive and negative elements, but no clear dominance, maybe NEUTRAL is appropriate here.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is primarily satisfied but has a minor complaint, it might still be positive. But in sentiment analysis, sometimes the presence of any negative aspect can make it neutral or even negative depending on the balance. However, since \"çok güzel\" is very strong, perhaps the overall sentiment leans positive despite the negative part. Hmm.\n\nBut looking at the example given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was NEUTRAL. That's a balanced view where the user is okay with the price but maybe not fully satisfied. Similarly, here, the user is happy with the beauty but unhappy about the color match. So it's a mixed sentiment. Therefore, labeling it as NEUTRAL might be correct.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user is talking about their experience with a product, probably a medication or something similar. They mention that on the first days they didn't think it would have any effect, but after three days, they started feeling burning and tightness in their legs. Then they say \"Tavsiye ediyorum,\" which means \"I recommend it.\" \n\nHmm, so there's a contradiction here. The physical symptoms they're describing—burning and tightness—are negative side effects. But they still end up recommending the product. That's interesting. Maybe they found that the benefits outweigh the side effects, or maybe they think others should try it despite the issues.\n\nI need to determine the sentiment label. The presence of negative symptoms would usually point to a negative sentiment, but the recommendation is positive. However, in many cases, if someone mentions adverse effects but still recommends the product, it might be neutral because they're acknowledging both pros and cons. But sometimes, people might mention side effects but still have an overall positive experience. \n\nWait, the user says \"Tavsiye ediyorum,\" which is a strong positive statement. Even though there were negative symptoms, the recommendation suggests that the overall experience was positive enough to endorse it. However, the mention of adverse effects could be seen as a warning, but the sentiment here might still lean towards positive because the conclusion is a recommendation.\n\nBut I should check if the main sentiment is positive or neutral. The user didn't express satisfaction with the product's effectiveness; they just mentioned that after three days, there were side effects. However, they still recommend it. That could be neutral because they're providing both negative and positive aspects without a clear overall positive or negative feeling.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recommendation overrides the negative symptoms, making it positive. But I'm not sure. In some contexts, mentioning side effects but recommending could be neutral. It's a bit tricky. Let me think again.\n\nThe key is whether the overall sentiment is more positive, negative, or neutral. The user experienced negative effects but still recommends the product. That might indicate that despite the issues, they found it beneficial enough to recommend. So maybe the label should be positive. However, if the recommendation is conditional (like \"despite the side effects, I recommend\"), it's possible that the sentiment is neutral because they're presenting both sides.\n\nBut in Turkish, when someone says \"Tavsiye ediyorum\" after mentioning negative experiences, it might still be a positive label because the recommendation is the main point. However, some might argue that the presence of negative symptoms makes it negative. But I think the overall intent here is to recommend despite the side effects, which leans towards positive.\n\nWait, but maybe not. If the user had a bad experience with side effects but still recommends, perhaps they are neutral because they're informing others about both pros and cons. However, in many cases, people who have negative experiences might not recommend, unless there's a strong benefit. So if they do recommend despite the issues, it could be positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is trying to warn others but still thinks it's worth using. That would be neutral. But I'm not entirely sure. The key is that the recommendation is explicit, which is a positive statement. Even with negative symptoms, the final action is recommending, so the sentiment might be positive.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user is clearly disappointed because the product didn't meet their expectations in terms of sizing. They might have thought XS would be a standard fit, but it turned out to be much larger. That's a negative experience. Even though they used \"normal boyfriend\" which might be neutral, the main issue is the size discrepancy, leading to dissatisfaction.\n\nI should check if there's any positive aspect, but the whole point seems to be about the wrong size.

If someone says a product is original, that's usually a positive thing because it implies authenticity. But here, the phrase is a bit ambiguous. Are they saying the product is original (positive) or that it's the same as an original (which might be neutral)? \n\nWait, maybe there's more to it.

So the sentence is saying \"the texture is bad\".\n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The word \"kötü\" is clearly negative.

The user is talking about a product from Golden Rose, which they love. They mention that it's a natural-looking lipstick with a beautiful texture and an affordable price. Words like \"en sevdiğim\" (my favorite), \"çok doğal\" (very natural), \"çok güzel\" (very beautiful), \"uygun fiyat\" (affordable price), and \"bayılıyorum\" (I'm obsessed) are all positive indicators.\n\nNext, I should check for any negative words or phrases. There's nothing here that suggests negativity. The user is expressing satisfaction with the product's quality and price. \n\nThe task requires labeling as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.

First, I need to analyze the sentiment here.\n\nThe first part is \"çok beğendim\", which translates to \"I really liked it\" in English. That's clearly positive. The second part is \"hiç türünculaştirmadi\". Wait, \"türünculaştirmadi\" might be a typo. Maybe they meant \"tüketti\" or \"tüketmedi\"? But even if it's misspelled, the word \"hiç\" means \"never\", and \"türünculaştirmadi\" could be a misspelling of \"tüketti\" (consumed) or something else. However, regardless of the exact word, the structure is \"hiç [something] did not\". So the user is saying that the product never caused them to do something negative, like not making them sick or not causing any issues. \n\nPutting it all together: The user liked the product (\"çok beğendim\") and mentions that it didn't cause any problems (\"hiç türünculaştirmadi\").

In Turkish, \"beğenmek\" means to like or approve of something. Adding the suffix \"-medim\" changes it to past tense negative. So \"Beğenmedim\" translates to \"I did not like it\" or \"I didn't approve.\" \n\nNow, looking at the sentiment labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The user's message is clearly expressing a negative feeling towards something. There's no ambiguity here. The person is stating they didn't like it, which directly points to a negative sentiment.\n\nI should check if there's any context I'm missing. But the text is straightforward.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Orijinalin aynısı\" translates to \"the exact same as the original,\" which is a bit of a compliment because it suggests that whatever is being referred to matches the original perfectly. Then there's \"harika,\" which means \"wonderful\" or \"amazing.\" That's clearly a positive adjective.\n\nSo putting it together, the sentence is saying that something is exactly like the original and wonderful. Both parts are positive. There's no negative language here. The user might be talking about a product, maybe a replica or a copy that's identical to the original and of high quality. \n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but in Turkish, \"harika\" is straightforwardly positive unless context suggests otherwise.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Asla\" translates to \"Never\" in English. Then \"Vazgeçmediğim ürün\" means \"The product I didn't give up on.\" So putting it together: \"Never. The product I didn't give up on.\"\n\nHmm, the use of \"never\" here might be emphasizing a strong stance. The second part talks about not giving up on a product, which could imply that the user has had a long-term relationship with the product, maybe even loyalty. But does that translate to positive sentiment?\n\nWait, but in Turkish, sometimes \"asla\" can be used in contexts that are negative. For example, if someone says \"Asla iyi değil,\" that's clearly negative. However, here it's just \"Asla.\" followed by a statement about not giving up on the product. \n\nThe key is whether the sentiment is positive or negative. The phrase \"vazgeçmediğim ürün\" suggests that the user has continued using the product despite possible challenges, which might indicate satisfaction. But without more context, it's tricky. However, the absence of any negative words and the implication of persistence could lean towards positive. Alternatively, maybe the user is expressing frustration that they couldn't give up on a bad product, but that seems less likely.\n\nWait, \"vazgeçmediğim\" means \"did not abandon,\" so the user is saying they never abandoned the product. That's more about loyalty or commitment rather than direct sentiment. But in the absence of explicit positive or negative words, maybe it's neutral? However, the use of \"asla\" might be emphasizing a strong feeling. \n\nBut looking at the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as neutral. So if there's no clear positive or negative indicator, it's neutral. Here, though, \"asla\" is a strong word. However, without context on whether the product is good or bad, maybe it's still neutral. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is expressing that they never gave up on the product, implying that despite issues, they kept using it, which could be negative. Or maybe they're proud of their loyalty, making it positive. It's ambiguous. However, in the absence of clear sentiment words like \"iyi\" (good) or \"kötü\" (bad), perhaps it's safer to label as neutral. But I'm not entirely certain. \n\nWait, looking back at the examples: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" is positive, \"Zehirlendim.\" is negative. The user's example for neutral was about price being okay. So in this case, since there's no explicit sentiment word and it's more about an action (not giving up), maybe it's neutral. But I'm still a bit confused because \"asla\" can be strong. However, without context on the product's quality, it's hard to tell. \n\nI think the safest bet here is to label it as NEUTRAL since there's no clear positive or negative sentiment expressed, just a statement of not giving up on the product.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user wrote, \"ürün güzel ama benim ten rengime açık geldi.\" Translating that to English: \"The product is nice but it didn't match my skin tone.\" \n\nFirst, the positive part is \"ürün güzel\" which means the product is good-looking or nice. That's a positive sentiment.\n\nThen there's the conjunction \"ama\" which means \"but,\" indicating a contrast. The second part is \"benim ten rengime açık geldi.\" The phrase \"açık gelmek\" can mean \"to be light\" or \"to not match.\" So, the user is saying that despite the product being nice, it didn't match their skin tone. \n\nNow, determining the overall sentiment. The first part is positive, but the second part introduces a negative aspect. However, the user isn't expressing strong dissatisfaction; they're just pointing out a mismatch. The word \"açık geldi\" might be neutral in some contexts, but here it's used to indicate that the product didn't suit their skin tone, which is a negative point.\n\nBut wait, sometimes people use \"açık gelmek\" in a more neutral way, like \"it turned out light.\" However, in the context of makeup or products related to skin tone, this would be a negative because it didn't match. So the overall sentiment is mixed but leaning towards negative because the main issue (not matching) is a significant drawback.\n\nHowever, the user might still have a neutral stance if they're just stating a fact without strong emotions. But considering the context of product satisfaction, the mismatch is a negative point. However, since there's both positive and negative elements, maybe it's neutral? Wait, but the instruction says to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. \n\nIn such cases where there are mixed sentiments, but the overall tone isn't strongly positive or negative, it might be considered NEUTRAL. However, if the negative part is more impactful, it could be NEGATIVE. But in this case, the user starts with a positive comment and then points out a problem. The presence of both could make it neutral. Alternatively, maybe the main sentiment is still positive because they acknowledged the product's quality but had a specific issue. \n\nBut I think the key here is that the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's suitability for their skin tone, which is a significant negative aspect. Even though they said \"güzel,\" the problem mentioned might outweigh the positive comment. However, in some cases, people might leave neutral reviews when they have mixed feelings. \n\nLooking at the example given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" translates to \"It's okay for the price,\" which is NEUTRAL. Similarly, here, even though there's a negative point, the user isn't strongly negative; they're just pointing out a specific issue. So maybe it's NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

But then they say they've changed their mind and won't return it because they don't want to bother, but they'll shop at better brands in the future.\n\nSo the initial sentiment is negative because they're complaining about the quality. However, there's a shift where they decide not to return it, which might be neutral or even slightly positive. But the overall context is still about dissatisfaction with the product and a decision to avoid similar products in the future. The main sentiment here seems to be negative due to the initial complaint and the intention to switch brands because of the poor quality.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

First, I need to understand the sentiment here.\n\nThe phrase starts with \"hiç cekmiyor\", which translates to \"doesn't even attract\" or \"not even worth it\". That sounds negative. Then \"bu paraya\" means \"for this price\", so they're saying it's not worth the money. The next part is \"anca bu kadar zaten\", which could be \"only this much anyway\" or \"that's all there is\". \n\nPutting it together, the user is expressing dissatisfaction, probably with a product or service, stating that it's not worth the price and there's nothing more to it.

The words \"hiç işe yaramıyor\" translate to \"doesn't work at all,\" which is clearly negative. Then \"çöpe attığım\" means \"threw it in the trash,\" and \"aldığımın ertesi günü\" is \"the day after I bought it.\" So they're expressing frustration that the product didn't work and had to be thrown away soon after purchase. The sentiment here is definitely negative. There's no positive or neutral language used. The context of discarding something immediately after buying it indicates a strong dissatisfaction.

The first part is \"Daha iyileri var tabi.\" which translates to \"Of course there are better ones.\" That sounds a bit negative because they're saying there are better options, but maybe it's just stating a fact.\n\nNext, \"Fiyatı uygun olunca denemek istedim\" means \"I wanted to try when the price was right.\" This part is neutral; they're just explaining their motivation to try it.\n\nThen, \"bayağı küçük fekattt.\" The word \"fekattt\" seems like a typo or slang. Maybe they meant \"fakat\" which is \"but\" in Turkish. So it would be \"bayağı küçük fakat\" meaning \"quite small but...\" But the original has extra 'ttt' at the end, which might be an emphasis or a mistake. However, even with that, the sentiment here could be negative if they're pointing out a flaw (small size) despite the price being right.\n\nPutting it all together: The user mentions there are better options, tried it because of the price, but found it too small. The overall sentiment seems negative because they're highlighting a drawback (size) even though they had a reason to try it. So the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user wrote, \"yumuşaklığı iyi ancak çok fazla kılı dökülüyor.\" Translating that to English: \"The softness is good, but too many hairs are falling out.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The first part, \"yumuşaklığı iyi\" (the softness is good) is positive. But then there's \"ancak çok fazla kılı dökülüyor\" (but too many hairs are falling out), which is negative. \n\nSo there's a contrast between a positive and a negative point. The user is pointing out both a good aspect and a significant issue. In such cases, the overall sentiment might lean towards negative if the problem is more impactful. However, sometimes it could be neutral if both aspects are balanced.\n\nBut looking at the example given in the instructions, when there's a mix of positive and negative, like \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (Okay for the price), it's considered neutral. But here, the negative part is about a product defect (hair falling out), which might be more critical than just being okay for the price.\n\nWait, but the example with \"Fiyatına göre okey\" is neutral because it's a balanced statement. In this case, the user mentions something positive but also a significant problem. However, since both parts are mentioned without one outweighing the other, maybe it's still neutral. But I need to check if the negative part is strong enough to make the overall sentiment negative.\n\nAlternatively, if the product has a major flaw (hair falling out), even though the softness is good, the user might be dissatisfied overall. However, the presence of both positive and negative aspects without clear emphasis could lead to neutral. But in some cases, the negative aspect might dominate.\n\nHmm, but according to the rules, if there's a mix, it's better to go with neutral unless one side is clearly stronger. Since \"çok fazla kılı dökülüyor\" (too many hairs falling out) is a strong negative point, maybe that tips the balance towards negative. However, the example given in the instructions where a mixed statement was considered neutral might suggest that even with both positive and negative, if they are presented as separate points without clear emphasis on one over the other, it's neutral.\n\nWait, but the example \"Fiyatına göre okey\" is more of an acceptance of a flaw because of price. Here, the user isn't accepting the hair loss; they're pointing out a problem despite the softness being good. So maybe that's more negative. But I'm not sure. It depends on whether the negative aspect is seen as a deal-breaker.\n\nAlternatively, since both aspects are mentioned without clear emphasis, it might be neutral. However, in some contexts, mentioning a significant issue even with a positive could lead to negative sentiment. But I need to follow the examples given. The user's instruction says that if there's a mix, like \"Fiyatına göre okey\" is neutral. So maybe here, since both points are mentioned without clear emphasis on one over the other, it's neutral.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the negative part is about a product defect, which might be more impactful than just being okay for the price. However, the example given was considered neutral. Maybe the key is that the user is not expressing strong dissatisfaction but rather pointing out both pros and cons. So maybe it's neutral.\n\nBut I'm still a bit confused. Let me think again. The first part is positive, the second is negative. If they are presented as separate points without one being more emphasized, then it's neutral. But if the negative aspect is seen as a major issue, even though there's a positive, maybe it's negative.\n\nBut according to the example given in the instructions, when there's a mix like \"Fiyatına göre okey\" (which is a balanced statement), it's considered neutral. So following that logic, this text might also be neutral because it has both positive and negative aspects without one clearly dominating.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user is talking about a product, probably a washing machine or something similar. They mention that even though it's been used 10 times, all the clips are broken. Then they compare it to a previous model from a different brand that lasted 5-6 years, but this one broke in just two months.\n\nThe key words here are \"bütün klipsleri kırıldı\" (all the clips are broken) and \"Bu 2 ayda gitti\" (this one broke in two months). These indicate dissatisfaction with the product's durability. The user is expressing frustration that the product didn't last as long as expected, especially when compared to a previous model from another brand.\n\nThe sentiment here seems negative because the user is highlighting the product's failure and short lifespan. Even though there's a mention of previous use, the overall tone is about the product not meeting expectations. There's no positive language here, just complaints about the clips breaking and the short duration of use. So the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The verb \"kokuyor\" means \"smells,\" so the sentence is saying something smells very nice and wonderful.\n\nLooking at the labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. Since all the adjectives here are clearly positive, the sentiment should be POSITIVE. There's no negative words or neutral terms.

The emoji used is a crying face, which typically conveys sadness or disappointment.\n\nSo, the user is expressing dissatisfaction. They're talking about not liking something (probably a product or service) and mentioning that their face was affected negatively, which adds to the negative sentiment.

But maybe they're negative because they had to return it so fast, implying dissatisfaction. However, without more context, it's tricky.\n\nWait, in Turkish, \"çok kisa\" might also mean that the return period was too short. If the user is saying they had to return it quickly, maybe they were forced to do so, which could be negative. Alternatively, if they're proud of returning it quickly, but that seems less likely. \n\nLooking at similar examples, like \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is neutral. Here, the user might be expressing a neutral sentiment about the return process. But I'm not entirely sure. The word \"iade\" (return) can have different connotations. If they're returning something quickly, maybe they're unhappy and want to get rid of it fast, but that's an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, if the context is about a refund or return policy, saying they returned it quickly might be positive if the process was efficient. But again, without more info, it's hard. The safest bet here is to label it as neutral since there's not enough information to determine a clear positive or negative sentiment.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The second part, \"O kadar övmeye değmez,\" translates to \"It doesn't deserve that much praise,\" which is a negative statement because it's downplaying the value or quality of something.\n\nCombining both parts, the overall sentiment seems negative. Even though the first part is neutral, the second part clearly expresses dissatisfaction or a negative opinion.

The word \"harika\" is a strong positive adjective. Even without context, the presence of such a positive term suggests a positive sentiment.

Since the overall sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative, but has both elements, the neutral label might be appropriate here. However, I need to check if the negatives outweigh the positives or vice versa. The user did mention some positive aspects, but the main issues are significant enough to tip it towards negative?

The user wrote, \"iki tarafida aşırı sert tavsiye etmiyorum.\" Translating that to English, it means \"I don't recommend either side excessively harshly.\" Hmm, the key words here are \"aşırı sert\" which translates to \"excessively harsh.\" The person is saying they don't recommend being too harsh on either side. \n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The user isn't expressing a positive or negative emotion directly. They're giving advice about not being overly strict, which might be neutral. But wait, maybe there's a nuance. If someone is advising against harshness, could that imply a negative sentiment towards harshness? However, the statement itself is more of an opinion or recommendation rather than expressing a positive or negative feeling.\n\nLooking at the examples provided: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled NEUTRAL because it's a balanced view.

The text is: \"Assssla asla gözüktüğü gibi değil yüksek bel ile alakası bile yok\". First, I need to understand what the user is saying here.\n\nThe word \"Assssla\" seems like an exaggerated form of \"asla\", which means \"never\" or \"not at all\" in Turkish. Then they say \"gözüktüğü gibi değil\" which translates to \"it's not as it appears\". The next part is \"yüksek bel ile alakası bile yok\", meaning \"there's no connection with high waist\".\n\nPutting this together, the user is expressing that something doesn't look like it seems and has nothing to do with a high waist. The use of \"asla\" twice emphasizes their strong negation. Words like \"alakası bile yok\" (not even related) show a negative sentiment towards whatever they're discussing, possibly a product or situation involving a high waist.\n\nNow, checking the rules: I need to label this as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The language here is clearly negative. They are strongly disagreeing with something and pointing out a lack of connection. There's no positive language here.

The first part is \"Kokusunu çok seviyorum,\" which translates to \"I really love the smell of it.\" The use of \"çok\" (very) and \"seviyorum\" (love) are strong positive indicators. \n\nThe second part: \"Avondan kullandığım nadir ürünlerden biri.\" Translates to \"One of the rare products I use from Avon.\" Here, \"nadir\" means rare or uncommon, which might imply that the user doesn't use many products from Avon, but the fact that they mention it as one of the rare ones they do use could be neutral. However, combined with the first part's strong positive sentiment, the overall tone is positive.\n\nI should check if there's any hidden negative connotation. \"Nadir\" might suggest scarcity, but in this context, it's more about personal preference rather than a negative aspect. The user is highlighting that they use this product despite it being rare, which could indicate satisfaction.\n\nSo, the main sentiment here is positive due to the explicit expression of love for the smell.

Then it mentions it arrived quickly (\"Hızlı geldi\") – another positive point. However, the user hasn't used the product yet (\"Ürünü işe henüz kullanmadım\"), which is neutral because they haven't had a chance to evaluate it. The last part is \"Ama Elseve ‘e güveniyorum,\" which translates to \"But I trust Elseve.\" Trust here is positive.\n\nNow, considering all parts: there are positive elements (packaging, delivery speed, trust in the brand) and a neutral part about not using the product yet. Since the overall sentiment leans towards positive aspects despite the neutral mention, the label should be POSITIVE. There's no negative language here, so NEGATIVE is out. NEUTRAL might be considered if there were more neutral or mixed sentiments, but the positives are strong enough to make it POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

However, they note that because it comes in a sealed package, they feel like full hygiene isn't achieved. \n\nHmm, so there are both positive and negative aspects here. The positives are about the product's effectiveness and value for money. The negatives are related to the packaging affecting perceived hygiene. But how do I balance these?\n\nThe user is expressing satisfaction with the product's performance but has a concern about the packaging. Since the main focus seems to be on the product's quality and price, which are positive, but there's a minor negative point about hygiene. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a mix of positive and negative, sometimes it depends on which aspect is more emphasized.\n\nWait, the user starts with positive statements and ends with a negative note. But the overall sentiment might still lean positive because the main aspects (product quality and price) are praised, while the packaging issue is a secondary concern. Alternatively, if the hygiene aspect is crucial for the product type, that could tip it to neutral or even negative.\n\nBut moisturizers are usually used on the skin, so hygiene might be important. However, the user says \"tam hijyeniklik sağlanmıyor gibi hissediyorum\" which translates to feeling like full hygiene isn't achieved. But they still call it a good product for its price. So maybe the overall sentiment is positive with a minor negative point, but in the JSON format, I have to choose one label.\n\nThe rules say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there are both positive and negative elements, but the positives are more about the core product benefits, while the negative is a secondary issue, maybe it's still positive. However, if the hygiene aspect is significant enough to make the overall sentiment neutral, that could be considered.\n\nAlternatively, since the user ends with a negative comment, even though they start positively, sometimes the ending can influence the sentiment more. But I need to check examples given. In the examples, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. Here, the user is satisfied with the price and product but has a concern about hygiene. So maybe it's neutral because there's a mix of positive and negative aspects without one clearly dominating.\n\nWait, but in the example, \"Fiyatına göre okey\" was neutral. In this case, the user says the product is good for its price (positive) but has an issue with packaging (negative). So maybe it's neutral because there are both positive and negative points. However, sometimes if the majority of the sentiment is positive, even with a minor negative, it might still be positive.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The key words here are \"iyi kaliteli\" which means \"high quality\" – that's definitely a positive term. Then there's \"urban care markadan bile iyi alabilirsiniz\". The phrase \"bile iyi alabilirsiniz\" translates to \"you can even get better\" from the Urban Care brand. So the user is saying that even though Urban Care is a good brand, you can find something better. \n\nWait, but the structure here might be tricky. The original sentence says \"iyi kaliteli urban care markadan bile iyi alabilirsiniz\". So it's like \"you can get even better from the high-quality Urban Care brand.\" Hmm, that seems a bit contradictory. If they're saying you can get better from a high-quality brand, maybe there's some sarcasm or irony here? Or perhaps the user is pointing out that despite being a good brand, there are better options available.\n\nBut in Turkish, sometimes the structure can be confusing. Let me check again. \"iyi kaliteli\" (high quality) + \"urban care markadan bile iyi alabilirsiniz\" (you can even get better from Urban Care). Wait, that might not make sense. Maybe it's supposed to mean that you can find something better than the high-quality Urban Care brand? That would be negative towards Urban Care, but positive about the alternative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is saying that even though Urban Care is a good brand, you can still get better quality elsewhere. So the sentiment here might be neutral because it's comparing and suggesting alternatives, not outright praising or criticizing. But \"iyi kaliteli\" is positive, while \"bile iyi alabilirsiniz\" could imply that there are even better options, which might lean towards negative for Urban Care but positive overall? Or maybe the user is just stating a fact without strong sentiment.\n\nWait, the original sentence structure: \"iyi kaliteli urban care markadan bile iyi alabilirsiniz\". The placement of \"bile\" (even) might be key. So it's like \"you can even get better from the high-quality Urban Care brand.\" That seems contradictory because if the brand is already high quality, why would you need to get better? Maybe there's a mistake in the sentence structure. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that despite being a good brand, you can find something better elsewhere. In that case, it's a negative sentiment towards Urban Care but positive about other options. However, since the instruction is to label the overall sentiment of the text, not the brand specifically.\n\nBut the main point here is that the user is suggesting that even though Urban Care is good, there are better alternatives. So the overall sentiment might be neutral because it's a comparison rather than an outright positive or negative statement. However, \"iyi kaliteli\" is positive, and \"bile iyi alabilirsiniz\" could imply that you can get even better, which might lean slightly positive if they're saying there are better options available. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the user might be implying that Urban Care isn't as good as other high-quality brands, making it negative.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me think again. If someone says \"you can get even better from X,\" where X is already considered good, does that mean they're suggesting X is not the best? That would be negative towards X but positive about others. However, the overall sentiment of the text might depend on whether the user is focusing on the comparison or the fact that there are better options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sentence is structured as \"you can get even better from a high-quality brand,\" which could mean that despite being high quality, you can find something better. That would be negative towards the brand but positive about the alternative. However, since the instruction is to label the entire text's sentiment, not just the brand, I need to consider the overall message.\n\nIn this case, the user is pointing out that even though Urban Care is a good brand, there are better options available. So the sentiment here might be neutral because it's an informative statement rather than expressing strong positive or negative emotions. The presence of both positive (\"iyi kaliteli\") and comparative elements (\"bile iyi alabilirsiniz\") could lead to a neutral label.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Translating that to English, it's something like \"It has a heavy and oppressive smell, didn't really resonate with me, but the lasting power is good.\" \n\nFirst, looking at the adjectives used: \"ağır\" (heavy) and \"baskın\" (oppressive) are both negative descriptors for the scent. Then \"çok içime sinmedi\" translates to \"didn't really resonate with me,\" which is a clear negative sentiment. However, the last part mentions \"kalıcılığı güzel\" meaning \"the lasting power is good,\" which is positive.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The user starts with strong negatives about the smell and personal resonance but ends on a positive note regarding longevity. But in reviews, the initial impressions often carry more weight, especially when there's a contrast between negative aspects and a single positive point. However, since the user mentions both negative and positive elements, it might be neutral. Wait, but the instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. \n\nBut let me check again. The main points: heavy and oppressive smell (negative), didn't resonate (negative), lasting power is good (positive). However, the negatives are more about the immediate experience, while the positive is a separate attribute. If the user is talking about a product like perfume, the lasting power being good might be a positive aspect, but the initial smell being bad could make the overall sentiment negative. But maybe the user is balanced? Or perhaps the positive part is enough to tip it to neutral?\n\nWait, the example given for NEUTRAL was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which translates to \"Okay considering the price,\" implying a mixed feeling but not strongly positive or negative. In this case, there are both negatives and a positive. However, the user might be expressing that despite the bad smell, the lasting power is good. But in terms of overall sentiment, if the main experience (smell and resonance) is negative, but one aspect is positive, it's possible the overall sentiment leans negative. Alternatively, since there are both positive and negative elements without a clear dominance, maybe NEUTRAL.\n\nBut I need to be careful. The instruction says to use the labels based on the dominant sentiment. If the user mentions more negatives than positives, even with one positive point, it might still be NEGATIVE. However, if the positive is significant enough, maybe POSITIVE. But in this case, the negative aspects are about the smell and personal resonance, which are important factors. The positive is about longevity, which might be a secondary factor. So overall, the sentiment is more negative. Wait, but the user didn't say it's bad overall, just that the smell was heavy and oppressive, didn't resonate, but the lasting power was good. It's possible they're neutral because they have mixed feelings without a clear positive or negative conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that they mentioned both negatives and a positive makes it NEUTRAL. But I need to check if there's any strong sentiment words. The word \"çok içime sinmedi\" is quite negative, indicating dissatisfaction. However, the positive part is also present. In such cases, sometimes the overall sentiment is considered neutral because there are conflicting opinions. So maybe the correct label here is NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Even though there's a mention of \"nedense\" (for some reason), it doesn't change the overall sentiment.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this analysis. The user provided a Turkish text that needs to be categorized as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. First, I'll read through the text carefully.\n\nThe text says: \"harika olmasada fena değil. Beklentimin altındaydı kokuyu daha güzel bekliyordum okuduğum yorumlara itinaden beklentim yuksekti\". Translating that to English, it's something like \"Not great, but not bad. It was below my expectations; I expected the smell to be better based on the reviews I read, my expectation was high.\"\n\nNow, breaking it down. The user starts with \"harika olmasada fena değil\" which translates to \"Not great, but not bad.\" That seems neutral at first glance. Then they mention that it was below their expectations (\"Beklentimin altındaydı\"), which is negative. They also say they expected the smell to be better based on reviews, indicating disappointment. However, they don't use strongly negative words like \"terrible\" or \"horrible,\" just expressions of unmet expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, there's no explicit positive language beyond \"fena değil\" (not bad). The overall sentiment here seems to lean towards negative because the user is expressing that their expectations weren't met, even though they acknowledge it wasn't entirely bad. The key point is the disappointment in not meeting high expectations set by previous reviews.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in such cases, people might use \"fena değil\" as a way to soften the blow, but combined with the mention of being below expectations, it's more negative than neutral. However, the user didn't use strong negative terms. So maybe NEUTRAL? But the expectation gap is a negative aspect. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the example given in the instructions: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled NEUTRAL. That's similar to \"not bad\" but not positive. In this case, the user has both elements of not being great and unmet expectations. The presence of disappointment might tip it towards NEGATIVE, even if it's not extremely negative.\n\nBut I need to be careful. If the main sentiment is dissatisfaction due to unmet expectations, that's negative. However, if the overall tone is just a mild complaint without strong negativity, maybe NEUTRAL. But in this case, the user clearly states their expectations were higher and the product didn't meet them, which is a negative experience.\n\nSo I think the correct label here is NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The phrase starts with \"umarım,\" which means \"I hope,\" indicating a positive expectation. However, the rest of the sentence is about waiting to see the effects over time. There's no explicit negative or positive emotion expressed beyond the hope.\n\nThe key words are \"umarım\" (hope) and \"zamanla\" (over time). The user is expressing a wish for something to happen in the future but isn't directly stating whether they're happy, sad, or neutral about it now. Since there's no strong positive or negative language, the sentiment might lean towards neutral.\n\nBut wait, \"umarım\" itself is a positive word because it expresses hope. However, the overall context doesn't have enough emotional weight to be definitively positive. The user isn't expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction; they're just stating an expectation.

There's no negative language here. The user is expressing satisfaction with the product's effectiveness and the result on their skin. Even phrases like \"ilk kullanımda etkisini gösterdi\" indicate that the product worked from the first use, which is a strong positive point.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden negative meaning, but in Turkish, sarcasm can be tricky. However, in this case, all the adjectives and verbs are clearly positive. No words that could imply dissatisfaction or neutrality.

However, there's also a mention of temporary relief (\"bir kaç saat rahat\"), but then the problem returns (\"su gibi terlemeye devm\" – continuing to sweat like water). \n\nThe overall sentiment seems negative because the main outcome (the product not working) is negative, even though there was some temporary relief.

Since the user is stating that they didn't see much effect, this implies dissatisfaction or disappointment. They expected something more impactful, which wasn't delivered. Therefore, the sentiment here leans towards negative. However, I should check if there's any ambiguity. The sentence doesn't have explicit positive words, but it's not overly harsh either. But \"goremedim\" (didn't see) in this context is more about unmet expectations, leading to a negative sentiment.\n\nSo, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this user review analysis. The text is in Turkish, so I need to make sure I understand the nuances correctly.\n\nThe user mentions that the brush part comes out and the back plastic part is coming off from the sides. That sounds like a negative point about the product's quality or durability. However, they also say it's not a very durable product but the usage is very good. \n\nSo there's a mix of negative aspects (parts coming loose, not durable) and a positive note about usability. But the overall sentiment might lean more towards negative because the product's structural issues are mentioned first, and even though usage is good, the durability is a significant drawback. However, the user also says \"kaliyeli\" which I think refers to being sturdy or durable. Wait, maybe there's a typo here? The word \"kaliyeli\" might be \"kaliteli\" (high quality). If that's the case, the user is saying it's not a high-quality product but the usage is good. \n\nSo the main points are: parts coming off (negative), not high quality (negative), but good in terms of use (positive). The negatives seem to outweigh the positive here because the product's structural integrity is an issue. However, the user might be giving a neutral rating if they're balancing both aspects. But usually, when there are clear defects, even if usage is okay, it's more negative. \n\nWait, but the user says \"çok kaliyeli bir ürün değil\" which translates to \"not a very durable product.\" So they acknowledge it's not durable, but the usage is good. Maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because they're pointing out flaws but also mentioning a positive aspect. However, in many cases, if there are significant issues with the product's quality, even if it works well, the sentiment might still be negative. \n\nHmm, I need to check the rules again. The labels are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. If the review has both positive and negative elements but no clear dominance, it could be neutral. But in this case, the user is pointing out flaws (parts coming off, not durable) which are significant negatives, but also mentions good usage. However, the main issue here is the product's quality and durability, which are critical factors. So even though usage is good, the negative aspects might make the overall sentiment more negative. \n\nAlternatively, if the user is saying it's not very durable but still works well, maybe they're giving a neutral rating because they're acknowledging both sides. But I think in most cases, when there are clear defects, especially in product quality, it would be considered negative. However, since the user also mentions that usage is good, it might balance out to neutral. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not overcomplicating. The key points: parts coming off (negative), not durable (negative), but usage is good (positive). Depending on the weight given to each aspect. If the product's quality issues are more impactful than the positive usage, then it's negative. If they're balanced, neutral. But in many contexts, product defects would be a stronger negative factor. However, the user might not be extremely dissatisfied but just pointing out flaws while still finding some value. \n\nI think the safest call here is NEGATIVE because the structural issues are significant and affect the product's quality, even if usage is good. The mention of \"not very durable\" is a strong negative point.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The second part is \"Gayet güzel,\" which translates to \"Very good\" or \"Excellent.\" That's a strong positive statement. \n\nThe user might be talking about a skincare routine, maybe using a product from the fridge. The action of letting it sit in the fridge could imply cooling, which is common with some skincare products. The use of \"Gayet güzel\" clearly indicates satisfaction. \n\nI should check if there are any negative words or neutral terms. Words like \"biraz\" (a bit) might suggest a minor inconvenience, but the overall sentiment is positive because of the explicit praise. The main verb here is \"sürüyorum\" (apply), which is neutral, but combined with \"gayet güzel,\" it's positive.\n\nNo negative words are present.

Then there's \"naneli parlatici sadece.\" \"Naneli\" means mint-flavored, and \"parlatici\" might be a typo for \"parlatıcı,\" which could mean something like \"shiny\" or \"sparkling.\" But the phrase \"sadece\" means \"only\" or \"just.\" So putting it together, maybe they're saying the product is only mint-flavored and shiny, but that's not the main issue here.

I recommend it.\" \n\nLooking at the keywords: \"işe yaradi\" means \"worked\" or \"was effective,\" which is positive. \"Saçlarimi kurutmadi\" translates to \"didn't dry my hair,\" which could be a negative point if drying hair is an issue, but in this context, since it's saying it didn't do that, maybe the product is good for not causing dryness. Then \"Öneririm\" means \"I recommend it,\" which is clearly positive.\n\nSo the user is expressing satisfaction with the product's effectiveness and its non-drying effect, ending with a recommendation.

The user is expressing frustration because they ordered two products and one wasn't delivered. Words like \"yollamadılar\" (they didn't send) indicate a negative experience. There's an expectation that both products should have been sent, but one was missing. This suggests dissatisfaction.\n\nLooking at the rules, I need to categorize this as either POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The user is clearly upset about the missing product, so it's not neutral.

The words \"yıllardır\" (for years) and \"kullandığım\" (I have used) suggest a long-term relationship with the product, which is positive. The mention of \"kokusun\" (scent) could be referring to a fragrance or perfume. The heart symbol adds an emotional aspect, showing fondness.\n\nLooking for any negative words or phrases. There's nothing here that indicates dissatisfaction or negativity. The tone is more nostalgic and affectionate. Even though it's about a product, the sentiment towards it is positive because of the long-term use and the emotional attachment indicated by the heart symbol.\n\nCould there be a neutral interpretation? Maybe if the user was just stating a fact without emotion, but the heart symbol and the use of \"sen\" (you) as if addressing the product personally adds a positive connotation. So it's more likely POSITIVE than NEUTRAL.\n\nNo negative words are present here. The overall sentiment is clearly positive.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The key parts are \"düzenli kullanmadım\" (didn't use regularly) and \"pekte işe yaramadı gibi\" (didn't seem to work much). The user is indicating that even though they didn't use the product consistently, it still didn't work well. \n\nThe words \"işe yaramadı\" directly translate to \"did not work,\" which is a negative statement.

Then \"almıyo\" is the negative form of \"alma\" (to take/buy), so \"I'm not buying it\". The second part is \"hiç memnun kalmadım\" which translates to \"I was never satisfied\". \n\nPutting it all together, the user is expressing strong dissatisfaction.

So the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the size being too small. \n\nLooking at the rules, I should label this as NEGATIVE. There's no ambiguity here since the sentiment is clearly negative.

The word \"saçı\" means hair. \"Lilamsı\" is a bit tricky. It might be a misspelling of \"lambalı,\" which means having lamb-like features, but that doesn't make sense here. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be \"lilimsi,\" which could relate to something resembling lilac or a color. However, the main verb is \"yapabiliyor,\" meaning \"can make\" or \"is able to make.\"\n\nPutting it together: \"Can make hair lilamsı.\" The user might be talking about a product that can make their hair look like lilacs or have a certain texture. But without more context, it's hard to tell the sentiment. If \"lilamsı\" is a positive attribute, like soft or shiny, then it could be positive. However, if it's a negative trait, like frizzy or damaged, then negative.

The word \"birebir\" here is positive because it's indicating a perfect fit. However, the context of \"batıklar\" might imply a negative situation.

The sentence is straightforward and clearly conveys a positive sentiment. \n\nI should check if there's any possibility of sarcasm or hidden meaning, but in Turkish, \"güzel\" is pretty direct.

However, they mention that there were a few changes (probably referring to headlights or something similar) and then add \"ama yine işe yarar,\" which translates to \"but still works.\" \n\nThe key here is the contrast between the initial statement and the conclusion.

The words \"yapış yapış\" mean sticky or adhesive. Now, I need to determine the sentiment here.\n\nFirst, I should check if there's any positive connotation. Words like \"harika\" (great) or \"iyi\" (good) would indicate positive. But here, \"yapış yapış\" is more about a physical state, not necessarily a positive trait. \n\nNext, negative words. If the user is complaining about their hair being sticky, that could be negative. However, the sentence doesn't have explicit negative words like \"kötü\" (bad) or \"zor\" (hard). It's just stating a fact.\n\nNeutral would be if there's no clear positive or negative sentiment. The sentence is describing a condition without expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

The user's instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since this is clearly a negative sentiment, the label should be NEGATIVE. I need to make sure there's no neutral aspect here.

The sentence is stating that something arrived quickly and without any issues. \n\nPositive emotions are usually associated with satisfaction, happiness, or relief. In this case, the user is expressing that the process was efficient and problem-free, which are positive outcomes. There's no negative language here, like complaints or dissatisfaction. The word \"sorunsuz\" directly indicates a positive experience, as it highlights the absence of problems.\n\nNeutral would be if the statement was factual without any emotional charge, but here the adjectives used clearly convey a positive sentiment.

So the sentence translates to something like \"A beautiful moisturizing lipstick.\" The user is probably talking about a product, maybe a lipstick that's both beautiful and moisturizing.\n\nNow, looking at the keywords: \"güzel\" is clearly positive. The rest of the words are descriptive but neutral in terms of sentiment. There's no negative language here. The structure is straightforward, just stating a positive attribute.

Translating this, it says something like, \"On the second day after I bought it, the threads started coming out and the fabric is very low quality.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The user is talking about a product they purchased. The key points are that on the second day, the threads started coming out (which indicates a problem with the product's durability), and the fabric is described as \"çok kalitesiz\" meaning very low quality. Both of these are negative aspects.\n\nLooking at the rules, I need to assign one of the labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's quality and a defect occurring shortly after purchase, this clearly points to a negative sentiment. There's no positive language here, just complaints about the product's performance and materials. \n\nI should make sure there's no ambiguity. Words like \"sökülmeye başladı\" (started coming out) and \"çok kalitesiz\" (very low quality) are strong indicators of dissatisfaction. Even though the user mentions the second day, which might be a neutral time frame, the context of the product failing so soon after purchase adds to the negative sentiment.\n\nNo need to consider any other factors here.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a Turkish text that needs sentiment analysis. The text is: \"paketleme çok kötüydu ve kargom çok gec geldi ama kullanimi iyi\". \n\nFirst, I'll break it down into parts. The first part is about the packaging (\"paketleme çok kötüydu\") which translates to \"the packaging was very bad.\" That's clearly negative.\n\nNext, they mention the delivery was late (\"kargom çok gec geldi\" – \"my package arrived very late\"). Another negative point.\n\nBut then there's \"ama kullanimi iyi\" – \"but the usage is good.\" So here's a positive aspect. \n\nNow, the challenge is to determine the overall sentiment. The user has mixed feelings: two negatives and one positive. However, in sentiment analysis, especially when there are multiple aspects, we need to see which part dominates. \n\nThe negatives here are about packaging and delivery, which are critical factors for customer satisfaction. The positive comment is about usability, which might be important but perhaps not as impactful as the negative experiences mentioned. \n\nBut sometimes, even with mixed elements, if there's a clear positive or negative sentiment overall, we should reflect that. However, in this case, since there are both negatives and a positive, it might lean towards neutral. Wait, but the instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. \n\nWait, the example given for \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is NEUTRAL. So if there's a mix of negative and positive, but not clearly one overriding the other, it might be considered neutral. However, in some cases, if the negatives are more significant, it could still be negative. \n\nBut according to standard sentiment analysis practices, when there are both positive and negative elements without clear dominance, it's often labeled as NEUTRAL. But I need to check the examples again. The example with \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral because it's a balanced statement. Similarly, here, even though there are negatives and a positive, maybe the overall sentiment isn't strongly negative or positive. However, the user might have a more negative experience due to the two negatives. \n\nBut the instruction says to use the labels as per the rules. The key is whether the overall sentiment is more negative, positive, or neutral. Since there are two negatives and one positive, but the positives are not strong enough to outweigh the negatives, maybe it's NEGATIVE. However, in some cases, if the positive part is a significant factor, it might be neutral. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the user mentioned both bad aspects (packaging and delivery) and a good aspect (usage), but the negatives are about the product's delivery and packaging, which are external factors, while the usage is about the product itself. If the product works well despite the issues, maybe it's more neutral. \n\nBut I think in this case, since there are two clear negative points and one positive, the overall sentiment would be NEGATIVE. However, different models might handle this differently. But according to standard practice, if the majority of the aspects are negative, even with a positive note, it could still be labeled as NEGATIVE. \n\nWait, but in the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral because it's a balanced statement. So maybe here, since there are both negatives and positives, even though two negatives, the presence of a positive might make it neutral. But I'm not sure. It depends on the context. \n\nAlternatively, if the negative aspects are about the service (packaging and delivery) and the positive is about the product's usage, maybe the overall sentiment is more negative because the service issues are significant. However, without clear guidelines on how to weigh different aspects, it's a bit tricky. \n\nIn some cases, mixed sentiments might be considered neutral. But I need to make a judgment here. Given that there are two negatives and one positive, but the positives are not as strong as the negatives, perhaps the label is NEGATIVE. However, if the user is saying that despite the bad packaging and delivery, the product itself is good, maybe it's more neutral. \n\nBut I think in this case, since the negatives are about the experience (packaging and delivery), which are important factors, even though the usage is good, the overall sentiment might still be NEGATIVE. However, different people might interpret it differently. But according to standard practice, if there's a mix of negative and positive but no clear dominance, it's neutral. \n\nWait, looking back at the examples: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" is positive, \"Zehirlendim.\" is negative, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. So in the third example, even though there's a positive aspect (okay price), but it's balanced with no strong sentiment, so neutral. Similarly, here, the user has two negatives and one positive. But maybe the overall sentiment isn't strongly negative or positive, hence NEUTRAL. \n\nAlternatively, if the negatives are more impactful, then NEGATIVE. But without explicit rules on how to weigh different aspects, it's ambiguous. However, since the user included both negatives and a positive, perhaps the safest label is NEUTRAL. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nIn some sentiment analysis models, the presence of any negative words might override positives unless there's a clear positive sentiment. But in this case, the user has two negatives and one positive. It's possible that the model would lean towards NEGATIVE because there are more negative aspects. However, without specific rules from the user on how to handle such cases, it's challenging. \n\nGiven the examples provided by the user, where \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral (a balanced statement), perhaps in this case, even with two negatives and one positive, if they are not strongly negative or positive, it might be considered NEUTRAL. But I'm still uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of multiple negatives makes it NEGATIVE. However, since there's a positive note, it could be neutral. This is a bit of a dilemma. \n\nIn conclusion, considering that the user has both negative and positive aspects but no clear dominance, the safest choice based on the examples provided would be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the text: \"kullanimi çok zor bilen alsin\". First, I need to analyze the sentiment here.\n\nBreaking it down, \"kullanimi\" means usage or use. \"Çok zor\" translates to \"very difficult\". Then \"bilen alsin\" is a bit tricky. \"Bilen\" is \"knowing\" or \"those who know\", and \"alsin\" is a verb meaning \"to take\" or \"to buy\". So the sentence might be saying something like \"Those who know it's very difficult to use, should buy it.\" \n\nWait, that doesn't make much sense. Maybe there's a typo? Perhaps \"bilen alsin\" could be \"bilen alsın\" with an 's' instead of 'n'? If that's the case, it would mean \"Let those who know take it\" or \"Let those who understand buy it.\" But even then, the sentiment isn't clear. The phrase \"çok zor\" is negative, indicating difficulty. However, the rest of the sentence might be suggesting that only those who are knowledgeable should proceed, which could be neutral or slightly positive if it's a recommendation for experts.\n\nBut without more context, the main point here is the mention of something being very difficult to use. That part is clearly negative. The rest of the sentence might be a conditional statement, but the core sentiment comes from \"çok zor\".

Then the second part: \"Bence sağlıklı\" means \"In my opinion, it's healthy.\" The word \"sağlıklı\" is definitely a positive adjective here. \n\nSo both parts of the sentence are expressing positive sentiments.

The user is clearly happy with the product and its health benefits. \n\nI should check if there's any hidden sarcasm, but Turkish doesn't use sarcasm as frequently as some other languages, and there's no indication here.

The key words are \"Asla göründüğü kadar büyük değil\" which translates to \"Not as big as it seems\", indicating disappointment or a negative experience. Then there's \"numune yollamıslar\" meaning \"they sent samples\", which might be neutral on its own, but combined with the next part, \"insanları kandırıyolar\" which is \"they are deceiving people\". \n\nThe use of \"kandırıyolar\" (deceiving) is a strong negative term.

The word \"kalitesiz\" is negative, indicating dissatisfaction. The intensifier \"çok\" strengthens that negativity. There's no positive language here, and it's not neutral because the user is clearly expressing a negative opinion about the quality.\n\nI should check if there's any context I'm missing, but the sentence is straightforward.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, looking at the words used. \"Bir paket fiyatına tam 40 adet\" translates to \"Exactly 40 units for the price of a package.\" That sounds like a good deal, right? The user is happy about getting a lot for a low price. Then there are the emojis: 🥰 and ☺️, which are both positive. The word \"teşekkürler\" means \"thank you,\" which is definitely a positive expression. They're thanking Trendyol, so that's a good sign.\n\nIs there any negative aspect here?

The sentence starts with \"Kesinlikle inceltme yapmıyor,\" which translates to \"Definitely doesn't make it too thin.\" That sounds positive because the user is pointing out a positive aspect—something not being too thin, which might be a good thing depending on context.\n\nNext part: \"Sadece biraz daha siki gosterebilir karin bolgesini.\" This means \"It could show the stomach area a bit more firmly.\" Here, the user is suggesting that there's room for improvement in how the stomach area is presented. The use of \"siki\" (firm) might imply that the current presentation isn't firm enough, which could be a negative point.\n\nThen the last part: \"Ben memnun kalmadim acikcasi.\" Translating to \"Honestly, I wasn't satisfied.\" This clearly indicates dissatisfaction. The user is expressing that they didn't feel content with the product or service, which leans heavily towards NEGATIVE.\n\nPutting it all together: While there's a positive note about not being too thin, the overall sentiment is negative due to the expressed dissatisfaction and the suggestion for improvement.

The text says something like, \"Thanks to this product, my nails have recovered. Normally, I have very thin, easily broken nails, but since using this product, there's been no breakage.\" \n\nFirst, I should check for positive words. Words like \"kendine geldi\" (recovered), \"hiç kırılma olmadı\" (no breakage) are positive indicators. The user is expressing satisfaction with the product's effectiveness.\n\nAre there any negative words? The original text mentions that without the product, the nails were weak and broke easily, but that's a problem solved by the product. So the negative part is about the previous state, not the product itself. The focus here is on the positive outcome after using the product.\n\nNeutral terms? Maybe \"ürün\" (product) is neutral, but the context around it is positive. The overall sentiment seems to be positive because the user is happy with the results. \n\nI should make sure there's no sarcasm or hidden negative meaning.

The user wants a sentiment analysis in JSON format with one of the labels POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the Turkish sentence. \"Dudağı yok ediyor\" translates to \"it is erasing the lip\" or \"it is removing the lip\". The verb \"yok etmek\" means \"to erase\" or \"to remove\", which has a negative connotation. The context here seems to be about something causing the lip to disappear, which could be related to a product's effect, like a cosmetic item that removes lip color, or maybe a medical condition. However, without more context, the direct translation and the verb used suggest a negative action. \n\nIn sentiment analysis, actions that are destructive or harmful are typically labeled as NEGATIVE. Even though there might be neutral contexts where removing something is necessary (like a medical treatment), the phrase doesn't provide enough information to assume that. The default interpretation here would lean towards negative because \"yok etmek\" is a strong term implying elimination or destruction.\n\nI should check if there's any possibility of it being neutral. For example, if it's a product that removes lip color as intended, but the sentence doesn't specify that. It just states the action without context. Therefore, the safest label based on the given information is NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user wrote, \"rengi resimdekiyle aynı değil ama güzel.\" Translating that to English, it means \"The color is not the same as in the picture but it's nice.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The first part of the sentence points out a discrepancy between the actual color and the image, which could be seen as a negative point. However, the second part uses \"ama güzel,\" which translates to \"but it's nice.\" The use of \"ama\" (but) indicates a contrast, where the speaker is acknowledging a flaw but then expressing a positive sentiment.\n\nIn terms of sentiment analysis, even though there's a negative aspect mentioned, the overall tone seems more positive because the user ends with a compliment. The key here is that the positive remark might outweigh the negative. However, I need to check if the primary sentiment is positive or neutral. \n\nBut wait, the user didn't just say it's nice; they specifically mention that the color isn't the same as in the picture. That's a negative point. But then they follow up with a positive statement. In such cases, the presence of both positive and negative elements can lead to a neutral sentiment if neither is dominant. However, sometimes the overall context might lean more towards one. \n\nLooking at examples provided earlier: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. That's similar because it's a mixed statement but ends on a somewhat positive note. In this case, the user is pointing out a flaw but then giving a positive remark. The key difference here is that in the example, the sentiment was neutral because it's a balanced view. Here, even though there's a negative point, the positive part might be stronger. However, since the user didn't express strong dissatisfaction, maybe it's still neutral.\n\nWait, but the example given for NEUTRAL was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is more of an acceptance rather than a positive or negative. In this case, the user says the color isn't the same (negative) but then says it's nice (positive). So there's a contrast, but the overall sentiment might be neutral because they're acknowledging both aspects without strong emotion either way.\n\nAlternatively, if the positive part is stronger, maybe it's POSITIVE. But I need to consider that the user is pointing out a specific issue. However, in the examples provided, similar structures were labeled as NEUTRAL when there was a contrast between negative and positive elements. For instance, \"Yemek harikaydı.\" was clearly positive, while \"Zehirlendim.\" was negative. The example with \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral because it's an acceptance.\n\nSo in this case, the user is pointing out a problem (color not matching) but then giving a positive comment (it's nice). Since both aspects are present and there's no strong emphasis on either, the label should be NEUTRAL. The key here is that the sentiment isn't overwhelmingly positive or negative; it's a balanced view with both elements.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The product failed after only a week, which is a short period, indicating poor quality or durability. The malfunctioning (opening and closing on its own) suggests a defect or design flaw. The user explicitly states they wouldn't recommend it, which is a strong indicator of dissatisfaction.\n\nLooking at the sentiment labels: POSITIVE would be if the user had a good experience, NEGATIVE for bad experiences, and NEUTRAL for mixed or indifferent opinions.

The recommendation against using the product is a clear negative sentiment.\n\nI need to make sure there's no hidden positive aspect.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, translating the Turkish part. \"10 dkda\" probably means \"within 10 minutes\" or \"in 10 days\"? Wait, \"dk\" is short for \"dakika,\" which is minutes. So \"10 dakikada açılan saçlar\" would be \"hair that opens in 10 minutes.\" But maybe the user meant \"10 days\" (gün) instead of minutes? Hmm, but the text says \"dkda,\" so it's definitely minutes.\n\nThe phrase \"gerçekten iyi\" translates to \"really good\" or \"truly good.\" So the sentence is saying that hair which opens in 10 minutes is really good. The sentiment here seems positive because they're complimenting the product (probably a hair straightener or something similar) for being effective quickly and being good.\n\nBut wait, could there be any sarcasm? Like maybe the user is implying that it's too fast? But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, in general, when someone says \"gerçekten iyi,\" they're expressing satisfaction.

The last part is neutral again, indicating they might change their mind.\n\nThe key is balancing these elements. The positive and negative aspects are both present but not strongly emphasized.

Maybe neutral here?\n\nNext: \"Tedirgindim alırken\" means \"I was worried when buying.\" That's a negative feeling, showing anxiety or hesitation.\n\nBut then they say, \"ama herkese tavsiye ediyorum\" which is \"but I recommend it to everyone.\" This is a strong positive endorsement despite the previous concerns.\n\nPutting it all together: The user had some negative feelings about the price and their own anxiety, but overall they are recommending the product.

The key words are \"gayet güzel\" which translates to \"very good\" or \"excellent,\" and \"tavsiye ederim\" meaning \"I recommend.\" Both of these are positive expressions. The user is clearly satisfied with the product's smell and is endorsing it.\n\nLooking at the rules, I need to make sure there's no ambiguity. There's no negative language here. Words like \"falanda iyi\" might be a bit tricky, but \"falanda\" in this context seems to reinforce the positive sentiment, similar to \"also good.\" \n\nI should also consider if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but Turkish doesn't use sarcasm as frequently as English, and the structure here is straightforward. The user is expressing satisfaction and giving a recommendation, which are both positive indicators.\n\nSo, the correct label here would be POSITIVE. No need to consider NEUTRAL because there's clear positive language. NEGATIVE is out of the question. Just to double-check, maybe \"falanda\" could mean something else? But in this context, it's used to add emphasis on the recommendation, so it still supports the positive sentiment.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this user review analysis. The text is in Turkish, so I need to make sure I understand the nuances correctly.\n\nFirst, the user mentions \"Orta Marka kaliteli olsa da şampuanın eksikleri var.\" So they're saying that even though it's a mid-range brand (which might imply decent quality), the shampoo has some drawbacks. That part sounds negative, but maybe neutral because they're just stating there are flaws.\n\nNext, \"Köpürmesi biraz zor bir ürün\" – the foaming is difficult. That's a negative point about the product's performance.\n\nThen, \"kokusunun da pek hoş olduğu söylenemez.\" The smell isn't very pleasant. Another negative aspect.\n\nHowever, they follow up with \"Ama gerçekten kepekleri azaltması hatta yok etmesi bakımından başarılı.\" But it's successful in reducing dandruff, even eliminating it. That's a strong positive point.\n\nSo the review has both negative and positive elements. The challenge is to determine the overall sentiment. Since there are both negatives and positives, but the user ends on a positive note about the main function (dandruff reduction), which might be a key factor for the product's purpose. However, the presence of multiple negative points could tip it towards neutral or even negative. But in some cases, if the positive aspect is significant enough, it might be positive.\n\nBut according to standard sentiment analysis rules, when there are mixed sentiments but no clear dominance, it's usually neutral. However, sometimes the overall context matters. Here, the user acknowledges flaws but highlights a major benefit. It's possible that the positive outcome (dandruff reduction) is more impactful, making the overall sentiment positive. But I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, since there are multiple negative points and one strong positive, it might balance out to neutral. However, in some analyses, if the positive aspect is a key feature that the product is intended for, it could override the negatives. \n\nLooking at examples provided earlier: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. So when there's a mix but no clear strong sentiment, it's neutral. Here, the user points out several negatives but also a significant positive. It might be neutral because the overall experience isn't overwhelmingly positive or negative. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe leaning towards neutral since the positives and negatives are both present without one clearly dominating.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The sentence is a warning or advice to people with sensitive skin about a product's firmness. \n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The user isn't directly expressing a positive or negative feeling about the product itself. Instead, they're giving a cautionary note.

Words like \"dikkat etmeli\" might imply that the product could be harsh, but the sentence doesn't state that explicitly. It's more about advising caution rather than expressing dissatisfaction.

The user is talking about a product's elasticity being very low, which is causing movement restrictions. So they're saying that because the product isn't elastic enough, there's limited movement. \n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The key words here are \"çok az\" (very little) and \"hareket kısıtlaması oluyor\" (movement restriction is occurring). These phrases indicate a problem or a negative aspect of the product. The user is pointing out a flaw in the product's design or quality, which would likely lead to dissatisfaction.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any positive nuance I'm missing. The sentence doesn't mention anything positive. It's purely about a drawback. So the sentiment here is negative. \n\nI need to make sure that \"NEUTRAL\" isn't applicable. Neutral would be if the user was just stating a fact without expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction. But in this case, the user is clearly indicating an issue caused by the product's low elasticity, which is a negative point.

So the person is saying they didn't like something and are asking for a refund.\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment.

All these are negative terms. The user is clearly expressing dissatisfaction with the product.

The mention of their hair becoming sticky suggests that the product had an adverse effect, leading to a negative experience. There's no positive language here, just complaints about the result.

The user wrote, \"Ürünün iyi ama fırça yok.\" Translating that to English, it's \"The product is good but there's no brush.\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment here. The sentence has two parts connected by \"ama,\" which means \"but.\" The first part is positive: \"ürünün iyi\" (the product is good). The second part is negative: \"fırça yok\" (no brush). \n\nNow, the challenge is figuring out whether the overall sentiment is more positive, negative, or neutral. The user is pointing out a flaw in the product despite acknowledging its quality. However, the absence of a brush might be considered a significant issue depending on the context. If the product is supposed to come with a brush and it's missing, that's a negative aspect. But since the user still mentions the product is good, there's a mix.\n\nBut according to the rules, I have to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The presence of both positive and negative elements might lean towards NEUTRAL. However, sometimes in such cases, if one part is strongly negative, it could tip the scale. But here, the user is stating a fact (the product is good) but pointing out a missing component. Since the main sentiment isn't overwhelmingly negative or positive, maybe NEUTRAL is appropriate. \n\nWait, but some might argue that the negative part is more impactful because it's a missing item, which could be crucial for the product's functionality. However, the user still acknowledges the product's quality. It's a bit of a toss-up. But according to standard sentiment analysis practices, when there are both positive and negative elements without clear dominance, NEUTRAL is often assigned. \n\nSo I think the correct label here is NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

However, there's also a suggestion that it works for others. But the main point is the dissatisfaction with the fit for larger chests.

The phrase itself is neutral because it's just stating that the price is appropriate. There's no positive or negative emotion here. It's a factual statement.

I should check if there's any neutral aspect, but the clear dissatisfaction and the emoji make it NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The second part is \"güneş koruyuculuğunu da zayif buldum\". \"Güneş koruyucu\" is sunscreen, and \"zayif buldum\" means I found it weak or insufficient. So the user is saying they found the sunscreen to be weak.\n\nPutting it together: The user is complaining about a product being oily and the sunscreen not being effective. Both points are negative.

The first part is \"Çok güzel bir ürün,\" which translates to \"A very beautiful product.\" The word \"çok güzel\" is clearly positive. Then the second part: \"Beklediğimden daha güzel ve büyük geldi.\" This means \"It arrived more beautiful and bigger than I expected.\" Both \"güzel\" (beautiful) and \"büyük\" (big) are positive adjectives. The user is expressing satisfaction because the product exceeded their expectations in both appearance and size.\n\nI should check if there's any negative connotation here. Words like \"zehirlendim\" (poisoned) or \"kötü\" (bad) would indicate negative, but that's not the case here. The entire text is filled with positive descriptors. Even the structure of the sentence emphasizes exceeding expectations, which is a strong positive indicator.\n\nNo neutral words are present.

The user provided the text: \"Çok sevdiğim yılların eskitemediği bir koku.\" I need to analyze the sentiment here.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Çok sevdiğim\" translates to \"I loved very much,\" which is clearly positive. Then \"yılların eskitemediği\" means \"the years that haven't aged\" or \"haven't passed.\" The phrase \"eskitemediği bir koku\" is a bit tricky. \"Koku\" means smell, but in Turkish, it can also metaphorically refer to a scent or memory. So the sentence is saying something like \"a scent that hasn't aged,\" which could be associated with nostalgia or cherished memories.\n\nThe user's sentiment here seems positive because they're talking about something they loved and that hasn't faded.

The phrase \"kaçırmayın\" is a bit tricky. It literally means \"don't miss,\" but in context, it's advising others not to miss out on the good price. So the overall tone is encouraging someone to take advantage of a good deal. There's no negative language here, just a positive recommendation.

The user wrote, \"Gayet güzel zamanla paslanmazsa daha da memnun kalıcam.\" Translating that to English: \"If it doesn't rust over time, I'll be even more satisfied.\" \n\nFirst, the key words here are \"gayet güzel\" which means \"very good\" or \"excellent,\" indicating a positive sentiment. Then there's a conditional part: \"zamanla paslanmazsa\" meaning \"if it doesn't rust over time.\" The speaker is expressing a hope that the product (probably something made of stainless steel) won't rust, which would lead to them being \"daha da memnun kalıcam\" – \"even more satisfied.\"\n\nSo the main sentiment here is positive because they're starting with a positive statement and then expressing satisfaction if a certain condition is met. Even though there's a conditional, the overall tone is still positive. There's no negative language used here.

The key parts are \"fiyatına göre\" (considering the price) and \"gayet iyi\" (quite good). The phrase \"gayet iyi\" is clearly positive. However, the context is about the smell (\"kokusu\") being good in relation to the price.\n\nBut wait, does mentioning the price affect the sentiment?

So the label should be POSITIVE.\n\nI need to make sure there's no hidden negative connotation. If the user had said \"fiyatına göre kötü\" (bad for the price), that would be negative.

The first part is \"fiyatina göre güzel\" which translates to \"good considering the price.\" That's a positive statement because they're saying it's good for the price.\n\nThen there's \"keşke hepsi sedefli olsaymis\" meaning \"I wish they were all made of seashell.\" This seems like a desire for something better, but it's not directly negative. It's more of a wishful thinking part.\n\nNext, \"mat olanlari beğenmedim\" translates to \"I didn't like the matte ones.\" Here, the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the matte items. That's a negative point.\n\nSo there's both positive and negative elements. The overall sentiment might be neutral because they're acknowledging the price is good but not liking some aspects.

But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if there's both positive and negative elements without one clearly dominating, it's neutral.

The user mentions using the product \"severek\" which means lovingly or enthusiastically. \"Vazgeçemediğim ürün\" translates to \"a product I can't do without,\" which strongly indicates a positive sentiment.\n\nThere are no negative words here.

The user provided a review in Turkish that says, \"Ürün güzel ama satıcı berbat paketlemişti paket açıktı ve fırça kılları bozulmuştu maalesef.\" I need to analyze this and determine the sentiment label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The user starts with \"Ürün güzel\" which translates to \"The product is good.\" That's a positive statement. But then they use \"ama\" which means \"but,\" indicating a contrast. The next part is \"satıcı berbat paketlemişti\" – \"the seller packed it badly.\" \"Berbat\" is a strong negative word meaning terrible or bad. Then they mention the package was open (\"paket açıktı\") and the brush bristles were damaged (\"fırça kılları bozulmuştu\"). The last part \"maalesef\" means \"unfortunately,\" adding to the negative sentiment.\n\nSo even though the product itself is good, the customer is expressing dissatisfaction with the packaging and the condition of the item upon arrival. The overall experience seems negative because the issues with packaging and damage affect their satisfaction. Even if the product is good, the problems encountered during delivery or handling by the seller are significant negatives here.

Then they mention \"kalitesi vasat,\" meaning \"the quality was average.\" While \"average\" might be neutral on its own, in this context, it's likely referring to lower than expected quality since the user had a disappointment.\n\nThe user also says they returned the item immediately (\"hemen iade ettim\"), which indicates dissatisfaction.

The user wrote, \"Kokusu güzel ama hiç kalıcı değil.\" Translating that to English, it's \"The smell is nice but it doesn't last at all.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The sentence has two parts connected by \"ama,\" which means \"but.\" The first part is positive: \"Kokusu güzel\" (the smell is nice). The second part is negative: \"hiç kalıcı değil\" (it doesn't last at all). \n\nNow, the challenge is determining whether the overall sentiment is more positive, negative, or neutral. Since there's a contrast between the two parts, I have to see which part carries more weight. The user starts with a positive comment but then follows it with a strong negative statement. However, in some cases, the presence of both positive and negative aspects might lead to a neutral sentiment if they balance each other out.\n\nBut wait, the structure here is \"positive aspect but negative aspect.\" Typically, when there's a contrast like this, the overall sentiment can be seen as negative because the second part (the negative) might overshadow the first. However, sometimes it depends on context. For example, if someone says, \"The product is good but expensive,\" that could be neutral. But in this case, the negative part is about the longevity of the smell, which is a significant drawback. \n\nHowever, the user didn't use any strong words to indicate that the negative part is more important. It's just stating two facts: the smell is nice, but it doesn't last. So maybe the sentiment isn't strongly positive or negative but rather neutral because both aspects are presented without clear emphasis on one over the other. \n\nBut I need to be careful here. In some cases, even if there's a contrast, the presence of both positive and negative can lead to a neutral label. However, sometimes the overall sentiment is determined by the combination. For example, \"The food was delicious but expensive\" might be neutral, while \"The service was terrible but the food was great\" could be more negative depending on context.\n\nIn this case, since the user mentions both positive and negative aspects without any clear indication of which is more important, it's safer to label it as NEUTRAL. The key here is that there's no strong sentiment leaning either way; it's a balanced statement with both pros and cons.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Both adjectives are connected by \"hem... hem...\" which is like \"both... and...\" in English.\n\nSo the user is saying something is both expensive and small. In many contexts, being expensive and small might not be positive. For example, if someone is talking about a product that's overpriced for its size, that's negative. But maybe there are cases where it's neutral? Like if they're just stating facts without judgment. However, the use of \"pahalı\" (expensive) usually carries a negative connotation unless it's in a context where high price is a positive, like luxury items. But since the user didn't specify any such context, I should assume the default.\n\nThe sentence structure doesn't have any clear positive words. Both adjectives are negative. So the sentiment here is likely NEGATIVE. The user might be dissatisfied with something being both overpriced and not big enough.

The emoji and the word \"hızlı\" (fast) reinforce the positive aspects of the service.\n\nPutting it all together, every part of the review has positive connotations.

The task is to classify it as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The user mentions buying something during a sale and expecting a certain quantity (1kutu), but when they opened the package, there were only two items instead of one box. They say \"bu fiyata gayet uygun bir ürün\" which translates to \"a product that's very suitable for this price.\" \n\nSo, the user is talking about a purchase where the quantity received was less than expected. However, they still mention that the product is a good fit for the price. There's a mix of disappointment about the quantity but satisfaction with the price. \n\nNow, I need to determine if the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The key here is whether the user's main sentiment is positive or negative despite the initial issue. They mention the product being suitable for the price, which is a positive note. However, the fact that they received less than expected could be seen as negative. But since they didn't express strong dissatisfaction and even said it's a good fit, maybe it leans more towards neutral. \n\nWait, but in Turkish, sometimes expressions can be tricky. The phrase \"bakalim kendisi nasil kullanimi basliyacagim\" might indicate uncertainty or hesitation about using the product, which could add a negative aspect. However, the main point is that they found the price appropriate despite the quantity issue. \n\nConsidering all this, the user's sentiment isn't strongly positive or negative. They have mixed feelings but overall seem to accept the situation, so NEUTRAL might be the best label here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

First, I need to understand what this means in Turkish. \"Ürünün rengi\" translates to \"the product's color,\" and \"çokta koyu\" means \"quite dark.\" So the sentence is saying the product's color is quite dark.\n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The words used here are neutral descriptions. There's no positive or negative adjective that indicates satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Words like \"koyu\" (dark) are just stating a fact about the color. Unless there's context implying that a dark color is bad or good, but in this case, it's just a statement of fact.\n\nI should check if there's any hidden sentiment. For example, sometimes people might use words that seem neutral but have underlying feelings. But here, \"çokta koyu\" is straightforward. It's not complaining about the color being too dark or praising it. So the sentiment is likely neutral.\n\nComparing to the examples given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral because it's a matter-of-fact statement. Similarly, this sentence is just stating an observation without positive or negative connotations. Therefore, the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The word \"memnun\" is a strong indicator of positive sentiment. The user is expressing satisfaction, which is clearly positive. There's no negative language here. Even though \"kaldım\" might be neutral on its own, combined with \"memnun,\" it reinforces the positive feeling.\n\nI should check if there's any ambiguity. The sentence is straightforward.

It seems like they're talking about fabric being too thin and wrinkling easily. The user is probably disappointed with the quality of the fabric.\n\nLooking at the emoticon at the end, it's a frowning face (:( ), which usually indicates negative emotions. The words \"ince geldi\" (too thin) and \"hemen kırışıyor\" (wrinkles immediately) are negative descriptors. The phrase \"beklediğimiz den\" suggests that the fabric didn't meet expectations.\n\nSo, the sentiment here is clearly negative. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's quality.

The user starts with \"Sürüyorum\" which means they're using the product, but then says they're not sure if it's beneficial. They mention they bought it based on a YouTuber's recommendation but also note that there are alternative options.\n\nBreaking it down: The initial part is neutral (\"Sürüyorum\") but then uncertainty about benefits (\"faydasını görüp görmediğimden emin değilim\") introduces some negative sentiment. However, the mention of an alternative suggests they're considering other options, which might be neutral or slightly negative. But overall, there's no strong positive or negative emotion.

The text is: \"Hediye için teşekkürler ama ürünü sulandırmışsınız o yoğunluğu bozulmuş ben hep alırım olmadı bu sefer 🤷🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️\". \n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The user starts with gratitude (\"teşekkürler\"), which is positive. But then they mention \"ürünü sulandırmışsınız\" and \"yoğunluğu bozulmuş\", which are negative terms indicating the product's quality was compromised. They also say \"ben hep alırım olmadı bu sefer\", suggesting disappointment because they usually buy it but this time it didn't work.

The user mentions \"uygun fiyata\" which means \"at a reasonable price,\" that's positive. Then they say \"güzel bir nemlendirici\" – \"a good moisturizer,\" another positive point. The part about the size being very big (\"boyutu çok büyük\") is also a positive remark because having a large size is usually seen as a benefit.\n\nThere's an emoji 👍🏻 which reinforces the positive sentiment.

The user starts by saying \"çok da güzel bir krem değil,\" which translates to \"It's not a very good cream.\" That sounds negative. Then they mention they were using Bioderma and were very satisfied with it. That part is positive. Next, they say they tried this one because it was affordable but didn't like it (\"bepenmedim\" which might be a typo for \"beğenmedim\" meaning \"didn't like it\").\n\nSo there's a mix of opinions here. The user had a positive experience with Bioderma but a negative one with the current product. However, the main focus seems to be on the current product they're discussing. They started by saying it's not good, then compared it to their previous satisfaction with another brand. Even though they mention being satisfied with Bioderma, the overall sentiment towards the product in question is negative because they didn't like it despite trying it due to affordability.\n\nI need to check if the neutral label applies here. Neutral would be if there's no clear positive or negative sentiment. But since they explicitly say it's not a good cream and didn't like it, that leans more towards negative. The mention of Bioderma is a comparison but doesn't change the sentiment about the current product. So the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Then \"inanılmaz beğendim\" means \"I was amazed and liked it.\" The use of \"beğendim\" (liked) and \"inanılmaz\" (unbelievable/amazing) are strong positive words. The emoji 🤗 also adds a positive sentiment, showing happiness or satisfaction.\n\nThere's no negative language here. The person is clearly expressing satisfaction and surprise in a positive way.

The user provided the text: \"Kirpiklrri tek tek ayırıyor muazzam.\" First, I need to analyze this sentence for sentiment.\n\nHmm, the word \"muazzam\" stands out. In Turkish, \"muazzam\" means magnificent or amazing, which is a positive term. However, the rest of the sentence might be important too. The user wrote \"Kirpiklrri tek tek ayırıyor\". Wait, \"kirpiklrri\" seems like a typo for \"kirpikleri\", which means eyelashes in Turkish. So the sentence is talking about someone separating each eyelash, and then using \"muazzam\" to describe it.\n\nBut wait, does the context make sense? Separating each eyelash sounds unusual. Maybe they're referring to a beauty treatment or something related to eyelashes. The use of \"muazzam\" here could be positive, but maybe there's sarcasm? However, without more context, it's hard to tell. Sarcasm can be tricky, but the user hasn't indicated any obvious sarcastic markers like quotation marks or exaggerated language.\n\nLooking at the structure: the subject is doing an action (separating each eyelash), and then \"muazzam\" is used as a descriptor. If someone is describing a process that's meticulous (\"tek tek ayırıyor\") and then calls it \"muazzam\", it might be positive. Alternatively, if the action itself is negative but described with a positive term, that could be ironic. But again, without more context, I have to go with the literal meaning.\n\nSo, considering just the words used, \"muazzam\" is positive. The rest of the sentence doesn't seem to carry a negative connotation. Therefore, the sentiment is likely positive. However, I should check if there's any possible misunderstanding. Maybe \"muazzam\" here is being used in a different way? But no, that's the standard meaning.\n\nTherefore, the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The user is clearly expressing dissatisfaction with the product's quality, fabric, fit, and craftsmanship.\n\nLooking at the rules, I need to label this as either POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.

The phrase \"hala faydasını göremedim\" translates to \"I still haven't seen the benefit\" or \"I can't see the benefit yet.\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is positive, negative, or neutral. The user is expressing that they haven't noticed any benefits, which could indicate dissatisfaction or disappointment. However, it's important to check if there's any ambiguity.\n\nThe word \"hala\" (still) suggests a continuation of a previous state, possibly implying frustration. The verb \"göremedim\" (haven't seen) indicates a lack of perceived benefit. This is more likely negative because the user is not satisfied with the outcome. \n\nBut wait, could it be neutral? If the user is just stating a fact without expressing strong emotions, maybe. However, in most contexts, when someone says they haven't seen any benefits, especially after some time or expectation, it's usually a negative sentiment. They might be implying that the product or service hasn't met their expectations.\n\nI should also consider cultural context. In Turkish, this kind of statement is often used to express dissatisfaction. There's no clear positive language here. So, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The person is expressing a hope that their purchase will be effective. There's no explicit positive or negative sentiment here.

The use of \"umarım\" (I hope) indicates uncertainty, which leans towards neutral.\n\nAlso, the repetition of \"r\" in \"yararrr\" might just be emphasis, but it doesn't change the sentiment.

These are negative points about the packaging and product condition.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this analysis. The user provided a Turkish text that needs to be categorized as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The user starts by saying they've never seen a worse quality piece of clothing in their life, comparing it to something like \"mankende ki gibi dökümlü durmuyor,\" which translates to something like \"it's not as frayed as in mankendeki (maybe a brand or a type of fabric).\" Then they mention that despite the poor quality, if someone were to buy it, there's only one size that would make them comfortable.\n\nBreaking this down, the initial part is clearly negative. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's quality, using strong language like \"daha kalitesiz kesimi kötü etek\" (worst quality piece of clothing). However, towards the end, they acknowledge that if someone were to purchase it, there's a specific size that might be comfortable. This part seems more neutral or even slightly positive, but the overall sentiment is dominated by the negative aspects.\n\nI need to determine whether the overall sentiment leans more negative or if the neutral part balances it out. Since the user is primarily complaining about the quality and only mentions a minor positive point (comfort in one size), the dominant emotion here is dissatisfaction. Therefore, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Fiyatına göre\" means \"Considering the price\" or \"In terms of price.\" Then \"normal kaliteli\" translates to \"normal quality\" or \"average quality.\" The phrase \"bir ürün\" is \"a product.\"\n\nSo the whole sentence is saying that the product has average quality considering its price. Now, I need to figure out the sentiment here. The user isn't explicitly happy or sad. They're stating a fact about the product's quality relative to its price. Words like \"normal\" and \"fiyatına göre\" suggest that the quality is in line with what one would expect for the price. There's no strong positive or negative language here. It's more of an objective statement.\n\nIn sentiment analysis, neutral is used when there's no clear positive or negative sentiment. Since the user isn't expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction but rather a balanced view, this should be labeled as NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Translating that to English: \"I couldn't see any benefit... it's not worth the money I paid... 😖\". \n\nFirst, looking at the words used: \"faydasını göremedim\" means they didn't see any benefit, which is negative. Then \"verdiğim paraya değmez\" translates to \"not worth the money,\" which is also a strong negative statement. The emoji used is a frowning face with open mouth and cold sweat, which typically conveys frustration or disappointment.\n\nSo both the text and the emoji are expressing dissatisfaction. There's no positive language here. The user is clearly unhappy with their purchase or experience. Even though there's a neutral part about not seeing any benefit, the overall sentiment is negative because they're complaining about the value for money. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any subtle positive cues, but in this case, everything points to a negative sentiment. The ellipsis after \"göremedim\" and \"değmez\" might indicate hesitation or emphasis on their disappointment. No neutral terms are present here; it's all about the lack of benefit and poor value. \n\nTherefore, the correct label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user is talking about a past purchase where the price was better than they expected. This suggests satisfaction with the price at the time of purchase. However, the word \"uygundu\" can sometimes be neutral, depending on context. But in this case, since it's comparing the price when buying to maybe a current or different expectation, it's more likely positive.\n\nWait, but the user might be implying that the price was better than usual or than what they thought. So, \"daha uygundu\" here is positive because it indicates that the price was favorable. The overall sentiment is positive because the user is expressing satisfaction with the price at the time of purchase. There's no negative language here. Even though \"uygundu\" can be neutral in some contexts, in this specific sentence, it's used to convey a positive experience. So the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The key words are \"zor\" (hard) and \"kullanılmaz\" (not suitable). Both of these words have negative connotations. The user is expressing difficulty in using the product and that it's not practical for everyday use.\n\nLooking at the rules, I should categorize this as NEGATIVE. There's no positive language here, just complaints about the product's usability. Even though there's a neutral part (\"gundelık kullanılmaz\" which is \"not suitable for daily use\"), the overall sentiment is negative because it's pointing out flaws.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden positive aspects, but in this case, the entire sentence is about problems.

The user wrote, \"Güzel ürün hızlı kargo daha ne olsun.\" Translating that to English, it's something like \"Good product, fast shipping, what else could there be?\" \n\nFirst, I need to check the sentiment here. The words \"güzel\" (good) and \"hızlı\" (fast) are positive adjectives. The phrase \"daha ne olsun\" translates to \"what else could there be,\" which is a bit tricky. It might be expressing that there's nothing more to add, implying satisfaction.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in Turkish, \"daha ne olsun\" can be used sarcastically. However, in this context, since the user is talking about a product and shipping, it seems like they're happy with both aspects. There's no negative language here. The overall tone is positive because they're highlighting good qualities of the product and service.\n\nI should make sure there are no hidden negatives. Words like \"hızlı kargo\" (fast shipping) are definitely positive. The structure of the sentence is listing positives, so it's likely a positive sentiment. No neutral words here either.

But as it is, \"asacak\" could be related to \"aşmak\" (to exceed) but not sure. Then \"gonderilmemis\" is \"not sent\" in Turkish. \"Kalitesiz\" means low quality. \n\nPutting it together: The user is saying that something wasn't sent and it's of poor quality.

But then the user mentions the packaging was bad and there were wrinkles. The negative aspects here are about the packaging quality.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The review has both positive and negative elements. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a mix, it might lean towards neutral unless one part is significantly stronger. But the user starts with a strong positive statement about the product itself, then points out a negative aspect of the packaging. \n\nBut wait, the main product here is the bra. The packaging is a separate issue. So the positive feedback is about the product's quality, and the negative is about the packaging. Depending on the context, sometimes the overall sentiment might be neutral if both aspects are equally weighted. However, in some cases, the core product's positive review might outweigh the packaging issue. But since the user specifically mentions two separate points—product quality (positive) and packaging (negative)—it's a mix.\n\nBut according to the rules given, I need to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The example for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which translates to \"Okay for the price,\" indicating a balanced view. In this case, since there are both positive and negative aspects without one clearly dominating, it might be considered neutral. However, sometimes if the product's main function is praised, even with some negatives, it could still be positive.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a text in Turkish that needs to be analyzed for sentiment. The text is: \"Buhar ya da duş sonrası kullanımda siyah noktalarım zamanla azaldı.sadece morarmaya karşı çekiş seviyesini iyi ayarlamak gerek\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user is talking about using steam or shower and how their black spots (maybe skin issues?) decreased over time. Then they mention that adjusting the tension level against redness is necessary.\n\nLooking for positive words: \"azaldı\" means decreased, which could be positive if it's referring to a problem decreasing. But the context here is about skin spots reducing, so that might be a positive outcome. However, the second part mentions needing to adjust tension against redness, which sounds like a challenge or something negative.\n\nBut wait, the user is stating that after using steam or shower, their black spots decreased over time. That's a positive effect. The second part says they need to adjust the tension level against redness. It might be a neutral statement because it's just a recommendation or a necessary step, not necessarily negative. \n\nHowever, in sentiment analysis, even if there's a mix, we have to determine the overall sentiment. The first part is positive (spots reduced), and the second part is more of a neutral observation about needing adjustment. So maybe the overall sentiment is positive because the main outcome is positive, but the user also mentions a necessary step. But sometimes, in such cases, if there's a problem that needs fixing, it might lean negative. However, since the user is just stating a fact and not expressing dissatisfaction, it might still be neutral.\n\nWait, the original example had \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" as neutral. So maybe when there's a mix of positive and neutral elements, but no clear negative emotions, it's considered neutral. Alternatively, if the main point is positive, even with some neutral parts, it could be positive. But I need to check Turkish sentiment analysis nuances.\n\nIn this case, the user is reporting a positive effect (spots reduced) but also mentions a necessary adjustment. However, since they're not complaining about the product or service, just stating facts and a recommendation, maybe it's more neutral. Or perhaps the positive outcome outweighs the neutral part. But I'm not sure. Maybe \"azaldı\" is positive, so the overall sentiment is positive. Alternatively, if the user had said that despite the reduction, there was an issue, but here they just mention needing to adjust tension, which might be a neutral comment.\n\nHmm. The key is whether the user is expressing satisfaction or not. Since they mention that the spots decreased over time, that's a positive outcome. The second part is about adjusting something, which could be seen as a minor inconvenience but not necessarily negative. So overall, maybe it's positive. But I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes in Turkish, even if there's a positive and neutral part, the presence of any challenge might make it neutral. However, the main point here is the reduction of spots, so I think POSITIVE is more accurate.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Wait, \"rimel\" is eyeliner in Turkish, so \"rimeli\" would be \"with eyeliner.\" Then \"tek gecerim\" – \"tek\" is \"only,\" and \"gecerim\" comes from \"geçmek,\" which means \"to pass\" or \"to go by.\" So putting it together: \"This one with eyeliner is the only one I pass by.\"\n\nHmm, maybe the user is talking about a product, like makeup? They might be saying that this particular item (with eyeliner) is the only one they use. But how does that translate to sentiment?\n\nThe sentence doesn't have obvious positive or negative words. It's more of a neutral statement. The person is just stating a fact about their usage. There's no explicit emotion, like \"harika\" (great) or \"zehirlendim\" (poisoned). So the sentiment here is likely neutral. They're not expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction, just stating a preference.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Then \"beklentimin ötesinde geldi\" means \"exceeded my expectations,\" another strong positive statement. The user also says \"teşekkür ederim,\" which is \"thank you,\" adding to the positive sentiment.\n\nI should check for any negative words or neutral terms, but there aren't any here.

The key words here are \"şans verilebilir\" which means \"a chance was given\" and \"beğendim\" which means \"I liked it\". \n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment. The phrase \"beğendim\" is clearly positive, indicating satisfaction or approval. However, there's a part about being given a chance, which might imply some hesitation or uncertainty. But in Turkish, when someone says they were given a chance and then express liking it, the overall sentiment tends to be positive.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden negative meaning, but the sentence structure doesn't suggest that. The user is straightforwardly stating they liked something after being given an opportunity. \n\nComparing with examples: \"Yemek harikaydı\" (positive) and \"Fiyatına göre okey\" (neutral). Here, the user's statement is more aligned with positive because of the explicit liking. Even though there's a mention of chance, it doesn't negate the positive sentiment expressed.\n\nSo, the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The words \"çok güzel\" are clearly positive. \"Uygun\" is a bit more neutral on its own, but in context, when combined with \"güzel,\" it's reinforcing the positive sentiment. There's no negative language here. So even though \"uygun\" might be neutral by itself, the overall phrase is positive. The user probably wants to know that this is a positive review.

The person is talking about a product, probably a hair care item. They mention that it's not suitable for their hair (\"uygun değil\"), which sounds negative. However, they also note that there was a hair mask included, and when used together, it softens their hair (\"yumuşatıyor saçlarımı\"), which is positive.\n\nSo the sentiment here is mixed. The initial part is negative, but the latter part is positive. But according to the rules, I have to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there are both negative and positive elements, but no clear dominance, maybe it's neutral? Wait, but the user might be indicating that despite the product not being suitable, the mask helps. However, the main sentiment could lean towards negative because the primary issue (not suitable) is mentioned first, but the positive effect is a mitigating factor.\n\nBut in some cases, if there's a mix of positive and negative, it might be neutral. But I need to check examples again. The example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is more of an indifferent statement. Here, the user has both complaints and positives.

The user provided the text: \"Beklediğimden küçük ama oldukça işe yarayan bir fırça.\" I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The first part is \"Beklediğimden küçük\" which translates to \"Smaller than expected.\" That sounds a bit negative because it's pointing out that the product didn't meet expectations in size. But then there's \"ama oldukça işe yarayan bir fırça,\" meaning \"but quite useful brush.\" The word \"ama\" is a contrast, so even though it was smaller than expected, the user found it useful.\n\nNow, I need to weigh these two parts. The negative aspect is about size not meeting expectations, but the positive part is about being useful. Which one takes precedence? In sentiment analysis, sometimes the overall tone depends on the balance between positive and negative elements. Here, the user acknowledges a downside (size) but emphasizes the usefulness. However, \"karşılamak\" might be a key here. The word \"karşılamak\" isn't in the text, but \"ise yarayan\" means useful. \n\nWait, the user says \"karşılamak\" is not present. So the main points are: smaller than expected (negative) and quite useful (positive). Since both aspects are present, but the overall sentiment might lean towards neutral because there's a mix of positive and negative elements. However, sometimes in such cases, if the positive aspect is stronger or more impactful, it could be positive. But here, the user mentions a drawback but also a benefit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that they mention it's useful despite being smaller than expected might make the overall sentiment neutral. Because they're pointing out both pros and cons without strongly leaning one way. So the label would be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

I recommend the ones that are like lipstick.\"\n\nFirst, they start with \"Çok güzel\" which means \"Very beautiful/good,\" so that's a positive point. However, then they mention \"sürmesi sıkıntı oluyor\" which translates to \"the wear is a problem.\" That's a negative aspect. The user is pointing out an issue with the product's durability.\n\nThen they say, \"Ruj gibi olanlarını tavsiye ederim,\" meaning \"I recommend the ones that are like lipstick.\" This part seems neutral because it's giving advice or a suggestion based on their experience. They're not expressing a strong positive or negative sentiment here; just offering an alternative.\n\nSo, the text has both positive and negative elements. But according to the rules for sentiment analysis, if there's a mix, we need to determine which one is dominant. However, in some cases, if the overall tone isn't clearly positive or negative, it might be neutral. But here, the user starts with a positive statement but immediately follows it with a complaint. The recommendation part is more of an actionable suggestion rather than a sentiment.\n\nIn such cases, the presence of both positive and negative aspects can lead to a mixed sentiment. However, since the instruction says to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL, and considering that the user is pointing out a significant drawback (\"sürmesi sıkıntı oluyor\") which might outweigh the initial positive comment, but there's also a recommendation which could be seen as neutral.\n\nBut looking at examples provided earlier: for instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled NEUTRAL. That's a balanced statement. Similarly, here, even though there's a negative point, the user is giving advice, so maybe it's leaning towards NEUTRAL. However, sometimes if there's a clear complaint, it might be NEGATIVE. But in this case, since they also mention something positive and then give a recommendation, perhaps it's more neutral.\n\nAlternatively, if the main sentiment is negative because the problem mentioned is significant, but the initial positive comment could balance it. Hmm. It's tricky. However, in many sentiment analysis models, mixed sentiments can be classified as NEUTRAL if there's no clear dominance. But I need to check the examples again. The example with \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral because it's a balanced statement. Here, the user is both praising and criticizing but also giving advice.

But typically, when someone says \"as expected\" and then points out a flaw, the primary sentiment is negative. The emoji could be neutral or even positive, but in this context, it's more likely used to express mild disappointment rather than genuine happiness.\n\nSo considering the overall message, the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's performance, even though they use an emoji that might seem positive.

The first part says \"Öyle kapatıcı etkisi kesinlikle yok\" which translates to \"There's definitely no such occlusive effect.\" That sounds like a negative point because they're pointing out a lack of a feature that might be expected in a sunscreen, maybe something about how it doesn't block completely or isn't as effective.

But here, the user says \"kesinlikle yok\" (definitely not) which is strong, but then follows with \"ama iyi bir güneş kremi\" (but it's a good sunscreen).

But I need to check the rules again.\n\nThe user instructions say that if there's a mix, but the overall sentiment isn't clear, then it should be neutral.

But \"uygun fiyat\" doesn't carry any positive or negative connotations on its own. It's a neutral observation. So the correct label here would be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a Turkish text that needs to be analyzed for sentiment. The text is: \"ürünün boyutu da işlevi de harika küçük diyenler yüzde ne kadar büyüğü kullanılabilir ki\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user mentions both the size and functionality of the product as \"harika\" which means amazing or great in Turkish. That's a positive point. However, there's a part where they talk about people who say it's small and question how much of it can be used. This seems like a negative aspect because they're pointing out a potential downside.\n\nBut wait, the structure is a bit confusing. The user starts with positive adjectives but then questions the size. Maybe they're sarcastic? Like, saying that even though the product is great in terms of size and function, people who say it's small might not be using it properly. Or maybe they're expressing frustration about the size being an issue despite the good aspects.\n\nI need to check if the overall sentiment leans positive, negative, or neutral. The initial part is positive, but the latter part introduces a negative point. However, the user isn't clearly stating dissatisfaction; they're more questioning. The use of \"yüzde ne kadar büyüğü kullanılabilir ki\" (how much of it can be used) might indicate confusion or a problem with the product's size, which could be negative. But since there's no explicit complaint, maybe it's neutral?\n\nWait, but the user is pointing out that even though the product has good aspects, there's an issue with its size. That could be seen as a mixed sentiment. However, according to the rules, I have to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since the text starts with positive adjectives and then questions the size, but doesn't clearly express dissatisfaction, maybe it's neutral? Or does the questioning imply a negative aspect?\n\nAlternatively, the user might be sarcastically saying that even though the product is great in some ways, people are complaining about the size. But without more context, it's hard to tell. The key here is whether the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Since there's both praise and a question about a potential downside, but no clear negative emotion expressed, maybe it's neutral? Or does the mention of the problem make it negative?\n\nHmm. In Turkish, sometimes people use sarcasm where they say something is good but then point out flaws. But without explicit negative words like \"kötü\" or \"memnun değilim\", it's tricky. The user uses \"harika\" which is positive, but then questions the size. Maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because there's a mix of positive and questioning, but not clearly negative.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is pointing out that despite being good in some aspects, the size is an issue, maybe it's leaning towards negative. But I'm not sure. The instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there's a clear positive statement and then a question about a possible downside without strong negative language, perhaps it's neutral.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Then the next sentence: \"Ter kokusunu kesinlikle engellemiyor.\" Meaning \"It definitely doesn't prevent body odor.\" The user is saying that the product isn't effective, which adds to the negative sentiment. The last part: \"Evde kullandığım karbonat daha başarılı.\" Translates to \"The baking soda I use at home is more successful.\" Here, they're comparing their current product (probably the one being reviewed) to another product (baking soda), stating that the other is better. This comparison reinforces the negative sentiment towards the product in question.\n\nLooking for any positive words or phrases, but there aren't any. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's effectiveness and prefers another alternative. There's no neutral language here; it's all about the negative experience.

The phrase \"yetmedi\" translates to \"was not enough\" or \"did not suffice.\" That already sounds negative. Then there's the emoji 😞, which is a frowning face with open mouth, typically used to express sadness or disappointment. \n\nSo combining the words and the emoji, the user is expressing that something (probably related to moisturizing, given the context of \"nemlendirmesi\") wasn't sufficient, leading to dissatisfaction. The use of the emoji reinforces the negative sentiment.\n\nI should check if there's any ambiguity. The word \"yetmedi\" is pretty clear in indicating a lack or insufficiency. There's no positive language here. Even though the text is short, the combination of the verb and the emoji makes the sentiment clearly negative. \n\nNo neutral words are present here.

The task is to classify this into POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since \"kötü\" is a strong negative word, and \"çok\" intensifies it, the sentiment here is clearly negative. There's no ambiguity here. The example given in the instructions had \"Zehirlendim.\" which was labeled as NEGATIVE, so similar to that case.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. Sometimes, context can change things, but in this case, it's straightforward. No sarcasm or mixed sentiments. Just a direct expression of dissatisfaction. So the correct label should be NEGATIVE. \n\nAlso, checking the rules again: only JSON output, no markdown, and strictly following the format.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user wrote, \"renk güzel ama yapışkan hissi veriyor,\" which translates to \"the color is nice but it gives a sticky feeling.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The first part, \"renk güzel\" (the color is nice), is clearly positive. However, the second part, \"ama yapışkan hissi veriyor\" (but it gives a sticky feeling), introduces a negative aspect. The use of \"ama\" (but) indicates a contrast between the two parts.\n\nNow, considering the rules for sentiment analysis in Turkish, when there's a mix of positive and negative elements, the overall sentiment depends on the context and which part is more emphasized. In this case, the user starts with a positive comment about the color but then points out a negative sensation (sticky feeling). \n\nThe challenge here is determining whether the negative aspect outweighs the positive one. Since the sticky feeling is a direct experience that might affect the product's usability or comfort, it could be seen as a significant drawback. However, the user still acknowledges the color as nice, which is a positive point.\n\nIn many sentiment analysis frameworks, if there are both positive and negative elements without clear dominance, the label might be neutral. But sometimes, the presence of a negative aspect can tip the balance towards negative, especially if it's a critical flaw. However, in this case, since the user mentions both aspects without strong emphasis on either, it might lean more towards neutral because they're presenting both sides without a clear preference.\n\nAlternatively, some systems might consider the negative part as more impactful because it's about the product's performance (sticky feeling) versus an aesthetic aspect (color). But I need to check if there are specific rules for Turkish sentiment analysis that prioritize certain aspects. Since the user hasn't provided such rules, I'll go with the general approach.\n\nConsidering the example given in the instructions: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (It's okay for the price) is labeled as neutral. Similarly, here, the user is pointing out both a positive and a negative aspect without strong sentiment towards either, so it might be neutral. However, if the negative part is more critical, maybe it's negative. But since the user didn't express strong dissatisfaction, just a mention of a drawback, it's safer to go with neutral.\n\nWait, but in the examples provided by the user, \"Yemek harikaydı.\" (The food was amazing) is positive, and \"Zehirlendim.\" (I got poisoned) is negative. The third example is \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is neutral. So, when there's a mix of positive and negative, but not strongly negative, it might be neutral.\n\nIn this case, the user says the color is good (positive) but mentions a sticky feeling (negative). Since both are present without clear dominance, the label should be neutral.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

First, I need to understand what this means in Turkish.\n\n\"Leke çıkarmada\" translates to \"in terms of stain removal.\" Then \"sıfır etki\" is \"zero effect.\" So the sentence is saying that there's no effect on stain removal. That sounds negative because if a product isn't effective at removing stains, that's a bad thing. The user might be talking about a cleaning product or something similar. The key words here are \"sıfır etki,\" which clearly indicates a lack of effectiveness. There's no positive language here, and it's not neutral because the absence of effect is a negative outcome.

The key word here is \"severek,\" which has a positive connotation. Using something \"lovingly\" suggests a positive feeling towards the product. Even though there's no explicit positive adjective like \"harika\" (great) or \"iyi\" (good), the verb \"severek\" implies affection.\n\nI should check if there's any ambiguity. The sentence is straightforward. The user is expressing that they use the product with love, which is clearly positive. No negative words are present. So the label should be POSITIVE.

That's a slight negative point about the sizing.\n- However, they say \"yinede güzel\" which means \"still good\" or \"but it's still nice,\" indicating a positive aspect despite the sizing issue.\n- The last part is \"nakislarina bayildim,\" which translates to \"I fell in love with the embroidery\" or \"the stitching.\" This is clearly a strong positive sentiment.\n\nSo there's a mix of slight negative (size was a bit big) and positive (still good, loved the embroidery).

The user provided a Turkish text, and I need to determine the sentiment label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The user starts by saying \"Yakıyor diyenlere inanmayın demişler ama kesinlikle inanın arkadaşlar 😲\" which translates to something like \"They said not to believe those who say it burns, but believe me friends.\" The emoji here is a surprised face, which might indicate some strong feeling. \n\nThen they mention the product's natural burning due to the pepper seed oil inside. They say they just bought it and think they'll be satisfied, and the reviews are great. They apply it after showering, and the first application was very hot but the burn lasted about 15-20 minutes. They note that for effectiveness, exercise is necessary.\n\nNow, breaking down the sentiment. The user acknowledges the product's effectiveness (\"memnun kalacağımı düşünüyorum\" - I think I'll be satisfied) and mentions positive reviews (\"yorumları harika\"). However, they also mention a negative experience with the first use being very hot and causing a burn. But they also say that the burn was temporary (15-20 minutes) and that exercise is needed for effectiveness.\n\nThe key here is balancing the positive and negative aspects. The user ends on a somewhat neutral note, stating that despite the initial discomfort, they think it's effective if you do sports. They don't express strong dissatisfaction but also acknowledge the product's drawbacks. However, the overall tone seems to lean towards positive because they mention satisfaction and positive reviews, even though there's some negative experience mentioned. But wait, the user says \"yakıyor diyenlere inanmayın demişler ama kesinlikle inanın\" which is a warning that it does burn, but they also say they are satisfied. The initial negative experience might be a con, but the overall sentiment is positive because they end up being satisfied and recommend others to believe the product works despite the burning.\n\nBut wait, there's a contradiction here. They mention that the first application was very hot and burned for 15-20 minutes, which could be seen as negative. However, they also say they think they'll be satisfied and that the reviews are great. The mention of needing exercise for effectiveness might be a neutral point. \n\nIn Turkish sentiment analysis, sometimes even if there are some negatives, if the overall conclusion is positive, it's labeled as POSITIVE. But I need to check if the negatives outweigh the positives here. The user has both positive and negative points but ends with a positive expectation (\"memnun kalacağımı düşünüyorum\").

Then \"beğendim\" translates to \"I liked it,\" another positive sentiment. \"Kaliteli\" is \"high quality,\" definitely positive. \"Günlük kullanıma çok güzel\" means \"very good for daily use,\" again a positive statement.\n\nThere's no negative language here.

The user provided a Turkish text that needs to be categorized as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The user starts by complaining about the shipping process taking too long (\"kargolanması... o kadar uzuuunn sürdü ki lanet ettim resmen aldığıma\"). That's clearly negative sentiment. Then they mention that the product looks good but has high vibration (\"Genel olarak güzel gibi görünüyor titreşimi çok yüksek bir ürün\"), which is a positive point. However, they also criticize the packaging (\"paketlenmesi çok kötüydü\") and the delivery time taking over a month (\"kargonun gelmesi 1 ayı geçti\"). \n\nSo there are mixed elements here. The product's appearance is good (positive), but the shipping and packaging are bad (negative). However, the overall tone seems more negative because the user is frustrated with the long wait and poor packaging, even though they mention the product looks good. The strong language like \"lanet ettim\" (cursed it) indicates a strong negative feeling. \n\nIn such cases where there are both positive and negative aspects but the negative aspects are more emphasized or impactful, the overall sentiment tends to be negative. The user's main complaint is about the delivery time and packaging, which are significant issues affecting their experience negatively. The positive comment about the product's appearance might be overshadowed by the negatives here.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct label here is NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user isn't overly positive, but they're not negative either. Words like \"idare eder\" suggest it's just okay, not bad but not excellent. In sentiment analysis terms, this would typically be neutral because there's no strong positive or negative emotion expressed. The person is stating a fact without enthusiasm or criticism.\n\nI should check if there are any hidden nuances. Maybe \"idare eder\" could have a slightly negative connotation, but in context, it's more about being acceptable. Since the user didn't use words like \"harika\" (great) or \"zehirli\" (poisonous), which would be clearly positive or negative, the label here should be neutral.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

However, the main issue here is that despite the product being good initially, it stopped working after two weeks. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's durability and functionality.

First, I need to understand what this means in Turkish. \"Kalıcı\" translates to \"permanent\" or \"lasting,\" and \"değil\" is \"not.\" So the phrase means \"not permanent\" or \"temporary.\"\n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The word \"kalıcı değil\" itself is neutral in terms of positive or negative connotation. It's stating a fact about something being temporary. However, depending on context, it could be either. For example, if someone says a product is \"kalıcı değil,\" that might be negative if they expected it to last. But without additional context, the phrase alone doesn't carry a clear positive or negative sentiment.

But wait, the context might matter here. If someone is saying they haven't noticed a difference, it could be neutral if they're just stating a fact, but the smiley adds a positive twist. However, sometimes people use smiles to soften a negative statement. But in this case, since there's no explicit negative word, and the smiley is present, it's more likely positive.

The word \"orta\" (medium/average) isn't inherently positive or negative. It's a neutral descriptor. However, sometimes in context, if someone says something is average, it might be seen as slightly negative because it's not excellent. But in many cases, especially when there's no comparison, it's just a factual statement.\n\nLooking at the rules again: the user specified that \"NEUTRAL\" should be used when the text doesn't clearly express positive or negative sentiment. Since \"orta kalitede\" is a neutral description without any emotional language, the correct label here would be NEUTRAL. The example given in the instructions where \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL supports this approach.

The user provided the text: \"eyeliner zaten güzel de bir bana mı koruma bantsız geldi?\" and wants a sentiment analysis in JSON format with labels POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the Turkish sentence. Translating it to English might help. The sentence seems to be asking something like, \"The eyeliner is already beautiful, but did it come without protection bands for me?\" There's a mix of positive and negative elements here. The user starts by saying the eyeliner is beautiful (positive), but then questions if it came without protective bands (which could be a negative point, maybe indicating a problem or inconvenience). \n\nHowever, in Turkish, sometimes the structure can be tricky. The phrase \"bir bana mı koruma bantsız geldi?\" might be expressing surprise or confusion about why the product didn't have protection bands. It's possible that the user is pointing out a flaw (negative) but starts with a positive statement. \n\nBut I need to determine the overall sentiment. If the main point is questioning the absence of something (protection bands), which could be seen as a negative, even though they start with a compliment. However, sometimes in such cases, the sentiment might be neutral if it's just an observation without strong negative or positive emotions. Alternatively, the user might be expressing dissatisfaction (negative) about the product not having protection bands despite being beautiful.\n\nWait, but the structure is \"zaten güzel de\" which means \"already beautiful, but...\" so the contrast here might indicate that the absence of protection bands is a negative point. So combining the positive and negative aspects, but the overall sentiment could be negative because the user is pointing out a problem. However, sometimes in such cases, if it's just an observation without strong emotional language, it might be neutral.\n\nBut looking at examples given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled NEUTRAL. So if the sentence has both positive and negative elements but no clear strong sentiment, it's neutral. But here, the user is questioning why the product didn't have protection bands, which could imply dissatisfaction (negative). However, the initial compliment might balance it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is just stating a fact without strong emotion. It's a bit ambiguous. In such cases, if there's no clear positive or negative words beyond the initial statement, but the question implies a problem, it might lean towards negative. But I need to be careful not to overinterpret.\n\nAnother angle: The use of \"bana mı\" (why me?) could indicate frustration, which is negative. So combining that with the absence of protection bands, even though they said it's beautiful, the overall sentiment might be negative.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a Turkish text that needs sentiment analysis. The text is: \"Kremi çok beğendim ama jelden memnun kalmadım belki yüze göre değişebilir ama yüzü fazla kurutuyor gibi geldi\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user starts by saying they liked the cream (\"Kremi çok beğendim\"), which is positive. Then they mention not being satisfied with the gel (\"jelden memnun kalmadım\") – that's negative. They then add a conditional statement about it possibly depending on the face, but then say it dries out the skin too much (\"yüzü fazla kurutuyor gibi geldi\"), which is another negative point.\n\nSo there are both positive and negative elements here. The challenge is to determine the overall sentiment. Since the user expressed both satisfaction with one product (cream) and dissatisfaction with another (gel), but the main complaint seems to be about the gel drying out the skin, which might be a stronger negative point. However, the initial positive comment could balance it. But in sentiment analysis, sometimes the presence of multiple sentiments can lead to neutral if they cancel each other out, or the dominant one takes over.\n\nBut looking at the structure: the user starts with a positive statement about the cream, then moves to a negative about the gel, and adds another negative point about drying. The negatives here are more specific and detailed, while the positive is a general like. It might lean towards negative overall because the dissatisfaction with the product (gel) is more impactful, especially since they mention it's drying the skin, which is a significant concern for skincare products.\n\nAlternatively, if the cream and gel are different products, maybe the user is talking about two separate items. But the context isn't clear. However, in Turkish, \"kremi\" and \"jelden\" could refer to different products. If that's the case, then there's a positive sentiment towards the cream and negative towards the gel. But since the instruction is to label the entire text, maybe it's considered mixed. However, the rules say to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. \n\nIn such cases, if there are both positive and negative sentiments without clear dominance, sometimes it's neutral. But here, the user might be reviewing a product that includes both cream and gel, leading to mixed feelings. However, the main complaint about the gel drying out the skin is a strong negative point. The initial positive comment might not outweigh the specific negative issues mentioned later.\n\nSo considering the overall sentiment, even though there's a positive part, the negatives are more detailed and concerning, so the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

First, I need to understand what this phrase means in Turkish.\n\n\"Fena\" usually has a negative connotation, like \"not good\" or \"bad.\" But the phrase is \"Fena sayılmaz,\" which translates to something like \"Not bad\" or \"It's not that bad.\" Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nActually, in Turkish, \"fena\" can mean \"bad,\" but when used in expressions like \"fena sayılmaz,\" it's often an idiom. I remember that \"fena sayılmaz\" is similar to saying \"it's not bad\" or \"it's okay.\" So the sentiment here might be neutral because it's a way of downplaying something negative without being entirely positive.\n\nBut wait, sometimes people use \"fena sayılmaz\" sarcastically. However, without more context, I should go with the standard interpretation. The phrase is commonly used to express that something isn't good but not terrible either. So it's more on the neutral side rather than clearly positive or negative.\n\nLet me check examples. If someone says \"Yemek fena sayılmaz,\" they might mean the food was okay, not great.

The context here is probably about the price being too low. \n\nNow, considering the sentiment. If someone says something isn't worth even a small amount of money, that's usually negative. They're expressing dissatisfaction with the value. So the sentiment here is likely negative.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or context I'm missing, but without more information, the straightforward interpretation is negative.

Then \"hafif mentol kokuyor\" means \"smells slightly like menthol,\" which is neutral.

So the whole phrase translates to \"Well packaged\" or \"Good packaging.\"\n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The word \"iyi\" is positive, so the overall sentiment here seems positive. There's no negative words or sarcasm indicated. The user is likely expressing satisfaction with how the product was packaged. \n\nLooking at the rules again: only JSON output, no markdown, and using the labels POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL.

The user provided the text: \"Kokusu biraazzcık kötü ama ömürlük kremmiş gibi görünüyor.\" I need to analyze the sentiment here.\n\nFirst, breaking it down. The first part is \"Kokusu biraazzcık kötü\" which translates to \"The smell is a bit bad.\" The word \"biraazzcık\" is a Turkish slang for \"a little\" or \"somewhat,\" so it's not extremely negative. Then there's \"ama ömürlük kremmiş gibi görünüyor\" meaning \"but it seems like it will last a lifetime (like cream).\" \n\nThe user is expressing that the smell isn't great, but they're hopeful about its longevity. The key here is balancing the two parts. The first part is negative, but the second part is positive. However, in sentiment analysis, we often look at the overall tone. Since there's a contrast with \"ama\" (but), it might lean more towards neutral because the user is pointing out a flaw but also seeing a positive aspect. Alternatively, if the positive part outweighs the negative, it could be positive. But since the negative comment is about the smell and the positive is about longevity, which are different aspects, maybe it's neutral. However, sometimes in such cases, people might consider the overall sentiment as slightly positive because they're focusing on the long-term benefit despite a minor issue. Wait, but the example given for \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. So if there's a mix of negative and positive without clear dominance, it's neutral.

Words like \"kırıldı\" (broke), \"çöp oldu\" (became trash) are negative. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with a product they purchased. They mention that the metal parts broke immediately after purchase, which indicates a problem with the product's quality or durability.\n\nThe phrase \"verdiğim para çöp oldu\" translates to \"the money I gave was trash,\" which strongly conveys frustration and regret over the purchase. This is a clear indicator of a negative sentiment. There's no positive language here, just complaints about the product failing and the money being wasted.\n\nI should check if there's any neutral or mixed sentiment, but all the expressions are clearly negative.

The user wrote: \"Güzel kopartıyor biraz acıtıyor, ama hepsini almıyor bilginiz olsun.\" Translating that to English, it's something like \"It peels nicely but a bit painful, but not all of them are taken, you should know.\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The user starts with \"Güzel kopartıyor\" which is positive (\"peels nicely\"). Then they mention \"biraz acıtıyor\" which is negative (\"a bit painful\"). But then there's a转折 (turn) with \"ama hepsini almıyor bilginiz olsun\" meaning \"but not all of them are taken, you should know.\" \n\nThe key here is the balance between positive and negative aspects. The user acknowledges both good and bad points. However, the overall sentiment might lean towards neutral because they're pointing out a drawback despite the initial positive comment. But I need to check if there's a stronger emotion.\n\nWait, \"ama hepsini almıyor\" could imply that the product isn't fully effective or not all parts are taken, which might be a negative point. However, the user is giving a warning or information rather than expressing strong dissatisfaction. The use of \"bilginiz olsun\" (you should know) suggests they're informing rather than complaining.\n\nSo combining both positive and negative elements without a clear dominance, the sentiment is likely neutral.

The emoji 🤑 is a winking face with money-mouth, which usually signifies something related to money, maybe a bit of sarcasm or satisfaction. However, in this context, since the user is stating that the price was suitable and they made a purchase, the overall sentiment seems positive. There's no negative language here.

The user wrote, \"Kokusu biraz ağır ama kalıcı.\" Translating that to English, it's \"The smell is a bit strong but lasting.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The sentence has two parts connected by \"ama,\" which means \"but\" in Turkish. The first part is \"biraz ağır,\" which translates to \"a bit strong\" or \"a bit heavy.\" That could be negative because \"ağır\" can imply something overwhelming or unpleasant.\n\nHowever, the second part is \"kalıcı,\" meaning \"lasting\" or \"durable.\" This is a positive trait because lasting often has a positive connotation, especially in contexts like perfumes or scents where longevity is a good thing. \n\nNow, I need to weigh these two parts. The user starts with a slight negative (\"a bit strong\") but then follows it with a positive (\"lasting\"). In sentiment analysis, when there's a contrast like this, the overall sentiment can depend on which part is emphasized more. However, since both are present and the sentence doesn't clearly lean towards one extreme, it might be neutral. \n\nBut wait, in some cases, even if there's a negative and positive aspect, the presence of \"ama\" (but) might indicate that the speaker is pointing out a drawback but then highlighting a benefit. However, the overall sentiment isn't strongly positive or negative; it's more of a balanced view. The user isn't expressing strong dissatisfaction or satisfaction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the positive part (\"kalıcı\") is considered more important here. If someone says something is strong but lasting, they might be implying that despite being strong (which could be a downside), it lasts long (a good thing). But in Turkish, \"ağır\" in the context of smell can sometimes be negative, like too intense. However, if the product is supposed to have a strong scent and it's lasting, maybe the user is neutral about it. \n\nBut I need to stick strictly to the given labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. Since there's both positive and negative aspects without clear dominance, the safest label here would be NEUTRAL. The sentence doesn't express a strong preference either way; it's more of an observation with mixed elements.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

However, the second part says \"bir ozelligi yok\", meaning \"there's no special feature\". \n\nSo the person is saying that while it's acceptable (idare eder), there's nothing standout about it. That sounds more like a neutral sentiment because they're not overly positive or negative. They acknowledge it's okay but point out the lack of unique qualities.\n\nI need to check if there's any hidden negativity or positivity. \"Idare eder\" is somewhat positive, but the absence of a special feature might lean towards neutral.

The person is talking about their hair being curly (\"kıvırcık\"), which is a neutral observation. Then they say \"ama tam begendigimi söyleyemem,\" which translates to \"but I can't say if it's exactly what I like.\" The use of \"ama\" (but) introduces a contrast. They might be expressing some dissatisfaction or uncertainty about their hair, even though it's curly.\n\nThe key part here is the second half where they mention not being able to fully express satisfaction. This suggests a negative sentiment because they're indicating that something isn't quite right, even if it's not explicitly stated as bad. However, there's no strong negative language like \"horrible\" or \"dislike.\" It's more of a neutral-negative leaning.\n\nBut wait, the first part is positive about the hair being curly, but the second part introduces doubt. The overall sentiment might be neutral because they're not clearly happy or unhappy. They're just expressing uncertainty. However, the presence of \"tam begendigimi söyleyemem\" (can't say if it's exactly what I like) implies some level of dissatisfaction, which could tip it towards negative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's neutral because they're just stating a fact without strong emotions.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this user review analysis. The user provided a Turkish text, and I need to determine the sentiment label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The user starts by saying they didn't order from here but have used BB and CC creams from Farmasi. They mention that the cream makes the skin look shiny and has good coverage compared to other BBs, and it doesn't make the face feel heavy, giving a feeling like there's a moisturizer. Then they talk about the price being best during sales on Trendyol, and how hard it is to find such prices in Farmasi catalogs. They also note that after some time, the cream doesn't keep the skin shiny anymore, but the initial effect lasts. Finally, they suggest buying with eyes closed.\n\nNow, breaking down the sentiment. The positive aspects are the good coverage, non-heavy feel, and the price during sales. However, there's a mention that the shine doesn't last long. But the overall tone seems to be more positive because despite the minor downside, the user recommends purchasing. The neutral parts are about the price comparison and the temporary effect of the shine. Since the majority of the feedback is positive with some neutral points and a small negative note, but the conclusion is a recommendation, which leans towards positive.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

First, I need to understand the Turkish words here. \"Çok\" means \"very\" or \"a lot,\" and \"kalitesiz\" translates to \"low quality\" or \"poor quality.\" So putting it together, the phrase is \"very low quality.\"\n\nNow, considering the sentiment labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The word \"kalitesiz\" is clearly negative. When someone says something is very low quality, that's a strong negative statement. There's no ambiguity here. The user isn't neutral; they're expressing dissatisfaction. So the correct label should be NEGATIVE.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other possible interpretations. Maybe \"kalitesiz\" could be used in a different context, but in this case, it's straightforward. The adverb \"çok\" intensifies the negative sentiment. No neutral words are present here. Therefore, the analysis points clearly to NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Then \"pahalı\" means expensive, also a negative term. Both adjectives are describing the product negatively. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with both the quality and the price.

The text is: \"Bende daha çok sivilce yaptı ya belki de deri altındakileri çıkarıp kurutup sonra bir daha çıkmayacaktır bilmiyorum.

The user is talking about acne (sivilce) and mentions that maybe the product is removing the ones under the skin, drying them out so they don't come back again. They're not sure, but they'll update their review after using it more.\n\nNow, looking for sentiment clues. The first part says \"daha çok sivilce yaptı\" which translates to \"made more acne.\" That sounds negative because having more acne is usually a bad experience. However, the user then mentions that maybe the product is removing the ones under the skin and drying them out so they don't come back. This could be seen as a positive outcome in the long run, but the uncertainty (\"bilmiyorum\") adds ambiguity.\n\nThe second sentence says they'll update their review after using it more. This indicates they're still evaluating the product and haven't formed a final opinion yet. The overall tone seems to be cautious or neutral because there's both a negative experience (more acne) and a potential positive outcome that hasn't been confirmed yet.\n\nI need to check if there are any strong positive or negative words. Words like \"harikaydı\" (was great) would be positive, but here the user is talking about more acne, which is negative. However, they're not certain about the long-term effects. The mention of updating the review suggests that the current sentiment isn't definitive.\n\nConsidering all this, the sentiment might lean towards neutral because there's a mix of negative experience and uncertainty about future results. The user isn't expressing clear satisfaction or dissatisfaction overall.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user wrote, \"Abartıldığı kadar bir etkisini görmedim.\" Translating that to English, it means something like \"I didn't see the effect as exaggerated as it was.\" Hmm, the key here is understanding the sentiment behind the statement.\n\nFirst, the word \"abartıldığı\" means \"exaggerated,\" so the person is saying that the effect wasn't as exaggerated as they thought. But wait, the structure of the sentence might be a bit tricky. The phrase \"kadar bir etkisini görmedim\" translates to \"I didn't see the effect as much as...\" So they're comparing the actual effect to an exaggerated one.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment. If someone says that something wasn't as bad or as intense as expected, that could be positive. But in this case, the user is talking about not seeing the effect (etkisini) as much as it was exaggerated. It might be neutral because they're just stating a fact without clear positive or negative emotions. Alternatively, if the context implies that the exaggeration was negative and the actual effect was less bad, maybe it's positive. But without more context, it's safer to go with neutral since the statement is more about observation than expressing a clear sentiment.\n\nI should check for any hidden negatives or positives. Words like \"görmedim\" (didn't see) might indicate disappointment, but combined with \"abartıldığı kadar\" (as exaggerated as), it's more about comparison. The user isn't clearly happy or sad; they're just stating that the effect wasn't as bad as expected. So neutral seems appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user provided the text: \"Çok bir olayı yok, normal tarak işte.\" I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Çok bir olayı yok\" translates to \"There isn't much happening\" or \"Nothing much is going on.\" That part seems neutral because it's stating a fact about there being no events. Then \"normal tarak işte\" – \"tarak\" here might be slang or a colloquial term. Maybe \"normal tarak\" is an idiom? In Turkish, \"tarak\" can sometimes mean a comb, but in this context, maybe it's used differently. \"İşte\" means \"well\" or \"so.\" So putting it together, \"normal tarak işte\" could be something like \"it's just normal\" or \"that's how it is.\" \n\nThe overall sentiment here doesn't seem positive or negative. The speaker is stating that there's nothing much happening and it's just normal. There's no strong emotion expressed. They're not complaining or excited, just making a neutral observation.

The user is clearly dissatisfied. Looking at the rules, I have to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since the words used are strongly negative, the label should be NEGATIVE. I need to make sure there's no ambiguity here. No neutral terms are present, and the intensity of the adjectives (\"çok kötü\") reinforces the negative sentiment.

Words like \"hiç tavsiye etmem\" (don't recommend at all) and \"kum gibi pütür pütür oluyor\" (feels like sand, gritty) are negative descriptors.\n\nThe key here is the shift from past use to current dissatisfaction.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the text: \"elektronik değil çok küçük oyuncak gibi\". I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, translating the Turkish text to understand better. \"Elektronik değil\" means \"not electronic\", and \"çok küçük oyuncak gibi\" translates to \"like a very small toy\". So the whole sentence is saying something isn't electronic but is like a small toy. \n\nNow, considering the context. If someone is talking about a product, maybe they expected it to be an electronic device but found out it's just a small toy instead. That could be negative if they were disappointed. But maybe they're happy because they wanted a simple toy? However, the phrase \"çok küçük\" (very small) might imply that the size is not what was expected, which could be a negative point. \n\nBut without more context, it's hard to tell the exact sentiment. The user might be expressing disappointment, but it's also possible they're neutral, just stating a fact. However, the use of \"değil\" (not) and \"gibi\" (like) suggests a comparison that might indicate dissatisfaction. \n\nAlternatively, if the product was supposed to be electronic but isn't, that could be negative. But if the user wanted a small toy and it's not electronic, maybe they're happy. However, the sentence doesn't have clear positive or negative words. It's more of a neutral observation. \n\nWait, the example given for neutral is \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which translates to \"Okay considering the price.\" So neutral is when there's no strong positive or negative sentiment. In this case, the user is comparing the product to a small toy instead of electronic. It might be a neutral comment because they're just describing it without expressing clear satisfaction or dissatisfaction. \n\nBut maybe the implication is that it's not as good as expected (if they wanted an electronic device), making it negative. However, without knowing their expectations, it's safer to go with neutral since there's no explicit positive or negative language.

The user provided the text: \"Yani bir kaç kez kullandık fakat tam etkisini hissedemedim.\" I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The person says they used it a few times but didn't feel the full effect. The key words here are \"bir kaç kez\" (a few times) and \"tam etkisini hissedemedim\" (didn't feel the full effect). \n\nThe use of \"fakat\" (but) indicates a contrast. They might have had some experience with it, but the result wasn't as expected. The phrase \"tam etkisini hissedemedim\" suggests dissatisfaction or that the product didn't meet their expectations. However, they didn't use it extensively (\"bir kaç kez\"), so maybe they're not entirely negative, just not impressed enough to be positive.\n\nBut wait, does this lean more towards negative? The user is expressing that even after using it a few times, they didn't feel the full effect. That could imply disappointment or lack of effectiveness, which might be negative. However, there's no strong negative language like \"kötü\" (bad) or \"memnun değilim\" (not satisfied). It's more of a neutral observation with a slight leaning towards negative because they didn't achieve the desired effect. But maybe it's still neutral since they're just stating their experience without strong emotions.\n\nHmm, but in sentiment analysis, even if there's no explicit positive or negative words, the context can determine the label. The fact that they couldn't feel the full effect might be seen as a negative outcome. However, the user didn't express clear dissatisfaction. It's possible to argue it's neutral because they're just reporting their experience without strong feelings either way.\n\nWait, looking at the example given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. That's a similar situation where the person is saying it's okay considering the price. So in this case, the user is saying that even after using it a few times, they didn't feel the full effect. It might be more neutral because they're not explicitly negative but also not positive. They just state their experience without strong sentiment.\n\nBut another angle: if someone uses a product and doesn't feel its effects, that could be seen as negative. However, since they used it only a few times, maybe they didn't give it enough time. So the sentiment might be neutral because the user is not clearly satisfied or dissatisfied but just stating their experience.\n\nI think in this case, the best label would be NEUTRAL. The user isn't expressing strong positive or negative emotions. They're just reporting that after a few uses, they didn't feel the full effect. There's no explicit complaint or praise here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user had a negative experience with the smell but a positive one with the product's performance. Since both aspects are mentioned, but the overall impression might be neutral because they're pointing out both pros and cons. But sometimes, the presence of both could lead to a more nuanced label.

However, the overall tone seems more on the negative side because they mention disappointment and that the product didn't meet their expectations. Even though there are some positives, the negatives seem to outweigh them here.

The user is talking about a child's clothing size, specifically mentioning that the sent item is a \"L\" size which is only suitable for a 5-6 year old. They also mention they will return it.\n\nFirst, I need to check the sentiment here. The user seems upset because they received an item that's not appropriate for the intended recipient (probably a child). Words like \"şakasınız heralde\" (maybe you're joking) and \"iade edicem\" (I'll return it) indicate dissatisfaction. However, there's no explicit negative language like curses or strong complaints. The tone is more about disappointment and a request for a refund rather than anger.\n\nBut wait, the user is pointing out a mistake in the product size, which could be a negative experience. Even though they're not using harsh words, the fact that they have to return the item suggests a negative outcome. However, the label \"NEGATIVE\" usually applies when there's clear frustration or strong dissatisfaction. In this case, it might be more neutral because they're just stating a fact and planning to return the item without emotional language.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's slightly negative because the user is expressing that the product was not suitable, which could imply a negative experience. But I need to check if there's any positive or neutral elements. The user isn't thanking anyone or showing any positive sentiment. They're just pointing out an error and stating they'll return it. So maybe \"NEGATIVE\" is appropriate here.\n\nWait, but the example given for \"NEUTRAL\" was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which translates to \"Okay for the price.\" That's a neutral statement. In this case, the user is not just being okay with it; they're pointing out an error and planning to return it, which might be more negative. However, the absence of strong emotional words could lean towards neutral.\n\nHmm, but in Turkish, when someone says they'll return something because it's wrong, that's a clear indication of dissatisfaction. So maybe \"NEGATIVE\" is correct here. But I need to make sure. Let me check again: The user is upset about receiving the wrong size and will return it. That's a negative experience.

The user is talking about their hair becoming hard and oily after starting a product. They mention negative effects like hair becoming brittle and breaking, which are clearly negative outcomes. However, they also mention that the product might make hair grow quickly, which could be seen as a positive.

These indicate dissatisfaction with the product's effects. Even though there's a mention of potential growth, the user is expressing doubt about whether the benefits outweigh the damage. \n\nSo, the sentiment here leans towards negative because the user is highlighting the adverse effects and uncertainty about the product's value despite possible benefits.

The text is: \"Saçlarım çikolata kahve ilk kullanımda etkisini göremedim pek ama umudum var sarıya göre daha zor dönecektir küllüye\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user is talking about their hair after using a product called \"çikolata kahve\" (chocolate coffee, maybe a hair dye or treatment). They mention that on the first use, they didn't see much effect (\"etkisini göremedim pek\"), but they have hope (\"umudum var\"). Then they compare it to \"sarıya göre daha zor dönecektir küllüye\" which translates roughly to \"it's harder to go back to yellow than to flaky (küllü)\".\n\nBreaking down the sentiment: The initial part is negative because they didn't see much effect. However, there's a positive note with \"umudum var\" indicating hope. The latter part seems neutral or slightly positive as they're comparing it to another state, maybe implying that the product is better than going back to yellow hair. \n\nBut I need to check if the overall sentiment leans more towards negative, positive, or neutral. The user didn't see immediate results but still has hope. In such cases, the presence of both negative and positive elements might lead to a neutral label. However, sometimes the dominant emotion is considered. Here, since they mention not seeing much effect (negative) but also having hope (positive), it's a mix. But in Turkish sentiment analysis, if there's a clear positive or negative term, that might take precedence. \"Umudum var\" is a positive statement, but the initial experience was negative. However, the overall context might be neutral because they're not strongly negative or positive. Alternatively, maybe the hope tips it to positive. But I need to be careful here.\n\nLooking at examples given: For instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. So if there's a mix of positive and negative but no strong sentiment, it's neutral. In this case, the user had a negative experience initially but has hope, which might balance out. However, the presence of \"umudum var\" could be seen as a positive note. But since the main experience was not effective, maybe it's more negative. Wait, but the example where someone says they didn't see much effect but have hope is considered neutral? Or does that lean towards positive?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key here is that the user is expressing some dissatisfaction (negative) but also optimism (positive). In such cases, if both are present and not clearly dominant, it's neutral. So I think the correct label here would be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The key words here are \"çok güzel,\" which are clearly positive adjectives. In Turkish, \"güzel\" is a strong positive term.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user wrote, \"Pek etkisi yok gibi ama güzel.\" Translating that to English, it's something like, \"Doesn't seem to have much effect, but it's nice.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentiment here. The first part is \"Pek etkisi yok gibi,\" which translates to \"Doesn't seem to have much effect.\" That sounds negative because it's pointing out a lack of impact or effectiveness. However, the second part is \"ama güzel,\" meaning \"but it's nice.\" This introduces a positive note.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The user is expressing two contrasting opinions: one negative and one positive. But in sentiment analysis, when there are conflicting sentiments, we have to see which one dominates or if they balance out. \n\nIn this case, the first part is more about the lack of effect, which might be a criticism, but the second part is a compliment. However, the use of \"ama\" (but) often indicates that the second part is the main point or the user's overall feeling. So even though there's a negative aspect mentioned, the positive remark might be the dominant sentiment here.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in Turkish, when someone says something like \"etkisi yok\" (no effect), it can be neutral if they're just stating a fact without strong emotion. However, combined with \"ama güzel,\" it's more about the user finding it nice despite the lack of effect. So maybe the overall sentiment is positive because the user ends on a positive note.\n\nAlternatively, if the negative part is stronger, like if they were complaining about the lack of effect, but here it's softened by the positive comment. It's a bit tricky. But in many cases, when there's a contrast with \"ama,\" the second part is more important. So I think the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user wrote: \"en sevdiğim rexona, paketleme yi açarken zorlandım🤣\". Translating that to English, it's something like \"My favorite Rexona, I had trouble opening the packaging 😂\". \n\nFirst, the person mentions they love Rexona (\"en sevdiğim\"), which is positive. But then they talk about having difficulty opening the package (\"zorlandım\"), which is a negative experience. However, there's an emoji here: \"🤣\", which is a laughing crying face. That usually indicates sarcasm or irony.\n\nPutting it together, the user is expressing frustration with the packaging but in a humorous way. The positive sentiment towards Rexona itself is overshadowed by the negative experience with the package. But because of the emoji and the context, it might be more neutral overall. Wait, but the main issue here is the difficulty opening the product, which is a negative point. However, the user's favorite brand is mentioned first, so there's a mix of positive and negative. \n\nBut in sentiment analysis, we have to consider the dominant emotion. The frustration with the packaging might be more significant than the initial positive mention. But the emoji adds a layer of humor, which could make it neutral. Alternatively, maybe the user is expressing that despite loving the product, the packaging was problematic. However, the overall sentiment here seems negative because the experience of opening the package was difficult, even though they like the brand. The emoji might be downplaying the frustration, but the main issue is still a negative one. \n\nWait, but in some cases, when someone says they had trouble but uses an emoji, it could be neutral. But I think the key here is that the user is pointing out a problem with the product's packaging, which is a negative aspect. Even though they like the brand, the experience of using the product (opening it) was bad. So the sentiment would lean towards negative. However, maybe the overall context is mixed. \n\nBut according to the rules, I need to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The main action here is the difficulty in opening the package, which is a negative experience. Even though they like the brand, the immediate issue is negative. So the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The text is: \"ben çok etkili olduğunu düşünmüyorum ve çabuk bitiyor küçük cunki elidorun kiler daha etkili\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user is talking about something not being very effective (\"etkili\") and mentions that it finishes quickly (\"çabuk bitiyor\"), which might be a negative point. They also compare it to \"elidorun kiler\" which are more effective. \n\nLooking at the keywords: \"düşünmüyorum\" (I don't think), \"çabuk bitiyor\" (finishes quickly, possibly implying it's not long-lasting), and \"daha etkili\" (more effective). The overall sentiment seems negative because the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's effectiveness and duration. \n\nBut wait, there's a part where they mention \"küçük cunki\" which might be a typo for \"çünkü\" (because). So the structure is: I don't think it's very effective, and it finishes quickly because Elidorun's are more effective. That reinforces the negative sentiment as they're comparing unfavorably to another product.\n\nNo positive words here. The main points are about ineffectiveness and quick depletion.

First, I need to analyze this in Turkish.\n\nThe phrase starts with \"ince biwey\", which might be a typo or slang. Maybe they meant \"ince bir şey\" (thin thing) but wrote \"biwey\"? Not sure. Then \"düşündüğümüz gibi değil\" translates to \"isn't like what we thought\". So the whole sentence is saying that something isn't as thin or maybe not as expected.\n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The user is expressing a contrast between expectation and reality. They might be disappointed or surprised. But without more context, it's hard to tell if it's positive or negative. However, the structure \"gibi değil\" (not like) often indicates disappointment, which leans towards negative. But maybe they're just stating a fact neutrally. Wait, but the use of \"ince\" (thin) and the contrast could imply that the item was expected to be thin but isn't, leading to dissatisfaction. So probably NEGATIVE. Alternatively, if it's a neutral observation without strong emotion, maybe NEUTRAL. But the presence of \"değil\" suggests a negative connotation here. I think NEGATIVE is more accurate.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user is talking about a previous experience with the product and mentions that it arrived safely.\n\nThe word \"sağlam geldi\" is positive because it indicates that the product arrived in good condition. However, the rest of the sentence doesn't express strong positive or negative emotions. There's no explicit praise or criticism beyond stating the product was used before and arrived safely. \n\nConsidering the rules, if there's a mix of neutral and positive elements but no clear negative sentiment, the label should be \"NEUTRAL.\" The user isn't expressing overt satisfaction or dissatisfaction; they're just reporting a fact about the product's arrival.

Words like \"asla\" (never) and \"sakın\" (don't) indicate strong negative sentiment. Comparing the product to tap water suggests it's of very low quality. \n\nLooking at the rules, I need to label this as either POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.

Then \"altın sarı\" translates to \"golden yellow\", which is a positive description. But then there's \"degl\" which might be a typo for \"degil\", meaning \"not\". So the sentence seems to be saying that the color isn't golden yellow as desired. The next part is \"çok köyü kötü bir sarı\" which translates to \"a very bad/bad yellow\". \n\nSo the user is expressing disappointment because the color they wanted (golden yellow) wasn't achieved, and instead, it's a bad yellow. Words like \"kötü\" (bad) are negative indicators. Even though there's a positive term \"altın sarı\", the context here is that it's not meeting expectations, leading to a negative sentiment. \n\nI should check if there's any ambiguity.

The repetition of \"kötü\" and the emojis strongly indicate a negative sentiment. The initial positive part might be a setup for the complaint, which is common in reviews where people mention expecting something good but ended up disappointed.\n\nI should check if there's any ambiguity.

So, the user is saying that when they use the product, they'll see the quality. Then \"umarım her derde devadır\" translates to \"I hope it's a solution to every problem.\" \n\nThe sentiment here seems mixed but leaning positive. The price is good, and there's hope for quality. However, the user hasn't used the product yet, so their experience isn't negative. The uncertainty about quality might make it neutral, but the overall tone is hopeful.

No sarcasm or mixed sentiments. The label should be NEGATIVE. Let me make sure there aren't any other possible interpretations. Maybe \"atlet\" could have a different meaning? No, in Turkish, \"atlet\" specifically refers to an athlete. So the analysis holds.\n\nTherefore, the correct label is NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the text: \"Perceive benim kokum klasik vazgeçemeyenlerdim\". First, I need to analyze this Turkish sentence to determine its sentiment.\n\nHmm, the sentence starts with \"Perceive\", which is an English word meaning 'to perceive' or 'to notice'. That's a bit out of place in a Turkish sentence. Then it says \"benim kokum\" which translates to \"my scent\" or \"my smell\". The next part is \"klasik vazgeçemeyenlerdim\". Breaking that down: \"klasik\" means classic, \"vuramayacaklar\" would be something like 'those who can't let go', but the actual word here is \"vuramayacaklar\" or maybe \"vuramazlar\"? Wait, the user wrote \"vuramayacaklar\" as \"vuramayacaklar\" but in the original text it's \"vuramayacaklar\". Wait no, the user's input is \"klasik vazgeçemeyenlerdim\". So \"vuramayacaklar\" isn't there. Let me check again.\n\nThe sentence is: \"Perceive benim kokum klasik vazgeçemeyenlerdim\". The last part is \"vuramayacaklar\" or maybe a typo? Wait, the user wrote \"vuramayacaklar\" but in their input it's \"vuramayacaklar\"? No, looking back: the original text is \"Perceive benim kokum klasik vazgeçemeyenlerdim\". So \"vuramayacaklar\" isn't present. The actual words are \"klasik vazgeçemeyenlerdim\". Let me parse that.\n\n\"Klasik\" is classic, \"vuramayacaklar\" would be 'those who can't let go', but the user wrote \"vuramayacaklar\" as \"vuramayacaklar\"? Wait no, the original text has \"vuramayacaklar\" or is it a typo? Let me check again. The user's input is: \"Perceive benim kokum klasik vazgeçemeyenlerdim\". So the last part is \"vuramayacaklar\" or maybe \"vuramazlar\"? Wait, no. The actual words are \"klasik vazgeçemeyenlerdim\". Let me break that down.\n\n\"Klasik\" (classic) + \"vuramayacaklar\" (those who can't let go). But the user wrote \"vuramayacaklar\" as \"vuramayacaklar\"? Wait, no. The original text is: \"Perceive benim kokum klasik vazgeçemeyenlerdim\". So the last part is \"vuramayacaklar\" or maybe a typo? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user wrote \"klasik vazgeçemeyenlerdim\". That's \"classic those who can't let go (plural) I am\". Wait, but the structure might be off. Maybe it's supposed to be \"vuramayacaklar\" but written as \"vuramayacaklar\"? Or is there a typo? Alternatively, maybe it's \"vuramazlar\" which would mean 'those who can't let go'. But I'm not sure.\n\nAssuming the sentence is trying to say something like \"Perceive my scent, classic ones who can't let go\", but the structure is a bit confusing. The use of \"Perceive\" at the beginning might be an attempt to start with an English word, which could indicate a mix of languages or a typo. \n\nNow, for sentiment analysis: the words used are \"benim kokum\" (my scent), \"klasik\" (classic), and \"vuramayacaklar\" (those who can't let go). The overall tone seems neutral because it's stating a fact about someone's scent and their attachment to classic things. There's no clear positive or negative emotion expressed here. It's more of a descriptive statement without strong sentiment.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The phrase \"iadare eder\" translates to something like \"is responsible\" or \"has to do\". The word \"yani\" means \"so\" or \"in other words\", which is used to clarify or explain a previous statement.\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment. The user isn't expressing a positive or negative emotion here. They're making a factual statement about someone being responsible. There's no clear indication of satisfaction, dissatisfaction, or neutrality beyond stating a fact.

The user mentions they read positive comments about the suction power and then confirms that it's true. They also end with \"teşekkürler,\" which means \"thank you.\" \n\nThe key words are \"çok güzel\" (very good) and \"teşekkürler.\" Both of these indicate a positive sentiment. Even though there's a mention of reading reviews, the overall tone is appreciative and satisfied. There's no negative language here.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the text: \"3 kullanımda bile farketti alın\". I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. The words are \"3\", \"kullanımda\", \"bile\", \"farketti\", \"alın\". Translating them: \"3 uses\", \"even\", \"noticed\", \"buy\". So the sentence is saying something like \"Even after 3 uses, noticed buy.\" Wait, that doesn't make complete sense in English. Maybe the original Turkish is more like \"After using it three times, I noticed to buy\" or \"Even after three uses, I noticed to buy.\" Hmm, maybe there's a typo or missing words. Alternatively, could it be \"3 kullanımda bile farketti alın\" meaning \"Even after 3 uses, noticed and bought\"? \n\nBut the key here is the sentiment. The user might be talking about a product they used three times and then decided to buy it. If they're saying that even after using it three times, they noticed something (maybe a benefit) and decided to buy, that could be positive. However, if \"farketti\" implies a negative experience, like noticing a problem, but the word \"alın\" is \"buy\", which is neutral. \n\nWait, maybe the sentence structure is different. Let me check again. \"3 kullanımda bile farketti alın.\" Maybe it's \"Even after three uses, I noticed and bought.\" If they noticed something positive that made them buy, then it's positive. But without more context, it's tricky. However, in Turkish, sometimes the structure can be a bit different. The word \"farketti\" is \"noticed\", but what was noticed? If the user noticed a benefit, then positive. If a problem, negative. Since there's no explicit positive or negative words here, maybe it's neutral because it's just stating an action (buying after noticing something) without indicating whether the experience was good or bad. But the act of buying could imply satisfaction. However, in some contexts, people might buy even if they had a negative experience. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"farketti\" is used in a way that implies realization. For example, \"I realized I needed to buy it after three uses.\" That would be neutral or positive. But without more context, the safest bet is to consider it neutral because there's no clear positive or negative sentiment expressed. The user might just be stating an action (buying) based on usage, but not expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The phrase itself is neutral in tone because it's expressing a moderate opinion without strong positive or negative emotions. It's more of an indifferent statement. For example, if someone says \"Çok değil,\" they might be indicating that something isn't particularly good or bad. \n\nBut wait, sometimes context can change the sentiment. However, since there's no additional context provided, I have to rely solely on the phrase. In isolation, \"Çok değil\" doesn't convey a strong positive or negative feeling.

The user mentions \"Kullanışlı küçük kısmı bazen çıkıyor ama geri takılabilir de sıkıntı olmuyor\" which translates to something like \"The useful small part sometimes comes out, but it can be reattached without any problem.\" That seems neutral or slightly positive because they're pointing out a feature that works.\n\nThen there's \"ama gelen görseldeki gibi değildi daha koyu ve daha farklıydı\" meaning \"but it wasn't like the image shown; it was darker and different.\" This part is negative because there's a discrepancy between expectation and reality.

However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a clear negative point (product not matching description), that might be labeled as NEGATIVE. But I need to check if the overall sentiment is more negative than positive. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's appearance, which is a significant factor. So maybe NEGATIVE. Alternatively, since they mention some positives and hope, it could be NEUTRAL. Hmm. It's tricky. In Turkish, the use of \"ama\" (but) often introduces a contrast. The main complaint is about the product not matching the image, which is a negative point. However, the user also mentions that the functional part works.

The emoji is a thumbs down, which usually indicates negative sentiment. Then the Turkish word \"beğenmedim\" translates to \"I didn't like it\" or \"I didn't approve of it.\" Both the emoji and the verb are strong indicators of dissatisfaction.\n\nNow, checking the rules: I must only output JSON with the label. No markdown, just pure JSON. The possible labels are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. Since both the emoji and the word are clearly negative, the label should be NEGATIVE. Let me make sure there's no ambiguity here. The user didn't use any neutral words or positive terms. It's a straightforward expression of dislike. So the correct JSON is {\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Because of that, they're continuing with the other product (\"o yüzden diğerine devam ediyorum\").\n\nSo there's a mix of positive and negative aspects. The positive part is about the smell, but the main issue is the effect on their hair, which they didn't like. Since the overall sentiment seems more negative due to the dissatisfaction with the product's effectiveness despite the good scent, I should label it as NEGATIVE. But wait, maybe it's neutral? They didn't say the product is bad overall, just that they prefer another one. However, the fact that they're continuing with the other product suggests they don't like this one enough to switch.

The user provided the text \"ürün renksiz geldi\" which translates to \"the product arrived colorless\" or \"the product came without color.\" I need to determine the sentiment here.\n\nFirst, the key words are \"renksiz,\" which means colorless or without color. In the context of a product, if it's supposed to be colored but arrived without color, that's likely an issue. The customer is probably disappointed because the product didn't meet their expectations. \n\nNow, checking the rules: I need to label this as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since the product not having color when it should, this is a negative experience. The user might be upset or dissatisfied. There's no positive language here, just a complaint about the product's condition. \n\nWait, could there be any neutral aspect? Maybe if the product was supposed to be colorless, but that's not indicated here. The original expectation isn't clear, but generally, if a product is described as having a certain color and it arrives without, that's negative.

The user wrote, \"Yumuşacık ve fiyatı çok uygun.\" Translating that to English, it's \"Soft and the price is very reasonable.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check the sentiment of each part. \"Yumuşacık\" means soft, which is a positive adjective describing the product's texture. Then, \"fiyatı çok uygun\" translates to \"the price is very reasonable,\" which is also positive because it's highlighting affordability.\n\nCombining both parts, the user is expressing satisfaction with both the quality (softness) and the price. There's no negative language here, just positive aspects. The word \"uygun\" (reasonable) might be neutral on its own, but in context, when paired with \"çok\" (very), it becomes a strong positive statement.\n\nI should make sure there are no hidden negatives or sarcasm.

There's no explicit positive or negative words here. Words like \"göründüğü\" (seems) and \"değil\" (not) are used, but they don't carry inherent sentiment.

In Turkish, using such emojis in a product review context would likely indicate satisfaction.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but the text seems straightforward. The user is praising the color and texture, calling it legendary. No negative words are present.

Also, mentioning that it didn't match the picture suggests disappointment.\n\nI need to check if there's any positive or neutral language here.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the text \"Güzel bir ürün ama küçük\". I need to analyze this and determine the sentiment.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Güzel bir ürün\" translates to \"A beautiful product,\" which is clearly positive. Then there's \"ama küçük\" meaning \"but small.\" The conjunction \"ama\" introduces a contrast. So the user is pointing out a positive aspect but also a negative one—size being too small.\n\nNow, considering the rules. The task is to classify the overall sentiment into POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there's both a positive and a negative part, I need to see which one dominates. However, in many cases, when there's a mix, it might lean towards neutral if both aspects are equally weighted. But sometimes, the presence of a positive followed by a negative can make it more negative, depending on context.\n\nBut wait, the example given for \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was NEUTRAL. That's a case where the user is saying it's okay considering the price. So maybe when there's a mix but no clear dominance, it's neutral. Here, the user says the product is good (positive) but small (negative). The overall sentiment might be neutral because they're pointing out both pros and cons without strongly leaning either way. Alternatively, if the negative part is a significant drawback, it could be negative. But since the example with \"ama\" in another context was neutral, maybe this should also be neutral.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The examples given: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" (positive), \"Zehirlendim.\" (negative), \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (neutral). So the third example is a case where there's a positive aspect (okay) but with a condition (price). In this case, the user says \"Güzel bir ürün\" (positive) but then adds a negative point. However, in Turkish, when someone says something like that, they might be indicating that despite the positive aspect, there's a drawback. But does that make it negative overall? Or is it neutral because both aspects are present?\n\nHmm. In some cases, if the user mentions a product is good but has a flaw, the sentiment could be mixed. However, according to the rules, we have to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there's both positive and negative elements, maybe it's neutral. But I need to check if the presence of \"ama\" (but) changes the overall sentiment. For example, in English, \"The product is good but small\" might be seen as a mild negative because the drawback is mentioned. However, depending on context, sometimes people consider that as a neutral review where both pros and cons are mentioned.\n\nLooking back at the examples provided by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was classified as NEUTRAL. That's a case where there's a positive (okay) but with a condition (price). So maybe in this case, even though there's a negative part (\"küçük\"), since it's a single point and the overall sentiment isn't strongly negative or positive, it would be neutral.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct label here is NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Then \"çok güzel paketlenmiş\" means \"very beautifully packaged.\" Both parts of the sentence are using positive adjectives. There's no negative language here, and it's not neutral.

The person is talking about starting something new and expressing hope that it will be effective. Words like \"umarım\" (I hope) indicate a positive expectation. However, there's no explicit positive or negative language. They're not complaining or overly excited.\n\nLooking at the rules again: if the text doesn't clearly express positive or negative emotions, it should be neutral. The user is cautiously optimistic but hasn't used strong positive words. The phrase \"bakalım\" (let's see) suggests uncertainty, which leans towards neutral rather than positive. \n\nSo, even though there's a hint of hope, the overall sentiment isn't strongly positive or negative.

The user wrote, \"ürün güzel ama kalıbı dar bedeninizden büyük beden alın.\" Translating that to English: \"The product is nice but the size is small, take a larger size than your usual.\" \n\nFirst, they start with a positive note saying the product is good (\"güzel\"). That's a positive sentiment. However, then they mention the size is too small (\"kalıbı dar\") and advise to choose a bigger size. This part is pointing out a negative aspect of the product—size issues.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The user has both positive and negative elements. But in sentiment analysis, if there's a mix, we have to see which part dominates. However, the instructions say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. \n\nBut wait, the example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which translates to \"Okay considering the price,\" implying a neutral stance despite some negatives. In this case, the user is giving a warning about the size but still acknowledges the product's quality. However, the negative aspect here might be more impactful because it's a practical issue (size) that could affect satisfaction. \n\nBut maybe the overall sentiment isn't purely negative. The user is not complaining about the product's quality but rather its sizing. So perhaps the sentiment is neutral? Wait, no. Because they did say \"ürün güzel\" which is positive, but then followed by a negative comment. However, in some cases, if there's both positive and negative, it might be considered mixed, but since we have to choose one label, maybe the dominant factor here is the advice given, which could be seen as a caution rather than outright negative. \n\nAlternatively, the presence of both positive and negative elements might lead to neutral. But I need to check the rules again. The examples show that if there's a mix but the overall sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative, it's neutral. For instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey\" is neutral because it's a balanced view. \n\nIn this case, the user is saying the product is good (positive) but has a sizing issue (negative). However, they are not expressing dissatisfaction with the product itself but rather giving advice on size selection. So maybe the overall sentiment isn't strongly negative or positive.

The main emotion here seems negative because the user didn't like the smell. However, there's a neutral action of giving it to someone else. But the primary feeling expressed is dissatisfaction with the product's smell. \n\nIn the guidelines, if the text has mixed sentiments but the dominant one is clear, we should go with that. Since the main point is the negative reaction to the scent, even though they gave it to their mom, the overall sentiment leans towards negative. \n\nI need to make sure there's no positive language here. Words like \"harikaydı\" (amazing) or \"okey\" (okay) aren't present. The neutral example was \"fiyatına göre okey,\" which is more about being okay with the price. Here, the dissatisfaction is clear. \n\nSo the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user starts by saying they used it once (\"tek seferde\") and that there was no miraculous result (\"müthiş bir sonuç çıkarmıyor\"). That part sounds negative because they're disappointed with the immediate effect.\n\nBut then they mention that with regular use (\"düzenli kullanımda\"), it reduces the black spot appearance (\"siyah nokta görüntüsünü azaltıyor\"). This part is positive because they're noting a benefit over time. \n\nSo there's a mix of negative and positive sentiments. However, the overall tone might lean towards neutral because the user acknowledges both the lack of immediate results and the long-term benefit. They aren't overly negative or positive; they're just stating their experience without strong emotional language on either side.\n\nI should check if there are any strong negative words that might tip it to NEGATIVE. \"Müthiş\" is usually a positive word, but here it's used in a negative context (\"müthiş bir sonuç çıkarmıyor\"), which means they expected something great but didn't get it. However, the second part about regular use being effective adds a positive note.\n\nConsidering both parts, the user is providing a balanced view without strong negative or positive emotions overall.

But then there's a negative point about the color corrector not absorbing properly. The user seems to have mixed feelings. They acknowledge the benefits but point out a drawback. \n\nSince the main focus here is on the negative aspect of the product not performing well in one area despite its other positives, the overall sentiment leans more towards negative.

The user might be expressing that even though they liked it, the product didn't deliver. However, the key part here is \"çok büyük bir etkisi yok,\" which is a strong negative statement.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a Turkish text that needs to be analyzed for sentiment. The text is: \"kapaticiligi güzel ama morumsu bir beyazlik benim tonum değil sanirim bugday tenliler almasin\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user starts by saying \"kapaticiligi güzel\" which translates to \"the coverage is good.\" That's a positive statement. But then they say \"ama morumsu bir beyazlik benim tonum değil\" meaning \"but the white color is too pinkish, not my tone.\" This part seems negative because they're expressing dissatisfaction with the color. \n\nNext, they add \"sanirim bugday tenliler almasin\" which I think means \"I think those with wheat tones shouldn't take it.\" This might be a neutral or slightly negative comment, suggesting that certain people shouldn't choose this product based on their skin tone.\n\nNow, considering the overall sentiment. The first part is positive, but the latter parts are more about the color not matching and a recommendation against it for some people. The user's main point seems to be that despite the good coverage, the color isn't suitable for them or others with wheat tones. \n\nIn Turkish sentiment analysis, even if there's a positive aspect, if the overall message is more about dissatisfaction or a negative experience, the label might lean towards negative. However, since they mentioned both pros and cons, but the conclusion is that it's not suitable, maybe it's neutral? Wait, but the initial part is positive, but the main issue here is the color mismatch, which is a significant drawback. \n\nLooking at the example given in the instructions: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" translates to \"Okay for the price,\" which is neutral. Similarly, here, even though there's a positive comment, the overall sentiment might be negative because the user is pointing out a major flaw (color not matching) and advising others against it. \n\nBut I need to check if the negative parts outweigh the positive. The structure is \"good coverage but the color is not suitable.\" In such cases, sometimes the sentiment is neutral because it's a mixed review. However, in some contexts, the negative aspect might dominate. But according to the examples provided, if there's a clear positive and negative part, how is it labeled? For instance, if someone says \"The product works well but the price is high,\" that would be neutral. \n\nIn this case, the user mentions a positive feature (good coverage) but then criticizes the color and advises against it for certain people. So it's a mixed sentiment. However, since the examples don't have such cases, maybe I should consider the dominant emotion. The user is not happy with the product because of the color, even though they liked the coverage. But the main issue here is the color mismatch, which might be more impactful. \n\nAlternatively, if the user had said \"The coverage is good, but the color isn't right,\" that's a negative sentiment because the main problem (color) is not resolved. However, in some cases, mixed sentiments are labeled as neutral. But looking at the examples again: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. So if there's a positive and a negative part but no clear dominance, it might be neutral. \n\nBut here, the user is saying that despite the good coverage, the color isn't suitable for them or others with wheat tones. That could be seen as a negative experience because they can't use the product effectively. Therefore, maybe the label should be NEGATIVE. However, if the sentiment is mixed but not strongly negative, it might be neutral. \n\nI need to decide based on the examples given. The example where \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. In this case, the user has a positive and a negative point. If the overall sentiment is more negative because they can't use the product due to color, then NEGATIVE. But if it's just a mixed review without strong negativity, maybe NEUTRAL. \n\nAlternatively, since the user is pointing out a significant flaw (color not matching) which might be a deal-breaker, even though there's a positive aspect, the overall sentiment could be negative. However, in some contexts, this would be considered neutral because it's a balanced review with both pros and cons. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. But according to standard sentiment analysis practices, if there are both positive and negative elements but no clear dominance, it might be labeled as NEUTRAL. However, the presence of a strong negative statement (color not suitable) could tip it towards NEGATIVE. \n\nBut looking at the examples again: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" is POSITIVE, \"Zehirlendim.\" is NEGATIVE, and \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is NEUTRAL. So in this case, the user's comment has both positive and negative aspects but ends with a recommendation against it for certain people. That might be considered more negative because they are advising others not to take it, which implies dissatisfaction. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct label here is NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The first part says \"Ürün kaliteli\" which translates to \"The product is high quality.\" That's a positive statement. Then there's \"ama\" which means \"but,\" indicating a contrast. The next part is \"dudak dolgunlaştırıcının bana bir faydası olmadı\" – \"the lip plumper didn't benefit me at all.\" That's negative. Finally, \"sağlam bir şekilde geldi\" – \"it arrived in good condition,\" which is positive again.\n\nSo there are both positive and negative elements here.

Since the sentiment analysis needs to be overall, I have to determine if the negatives outweigh the positives or vice versa.

But sometimes, if both positive and negative are present without a clear dominance, it could be neutral. However, in this case, the user is giving a product review with both positive aspects (quality, arrival) and a negative aspect (ineffectiveness of the lip plumper). Since the main point of the review seems to be about the product's effectiveness, which is negative, but there are also positives. \n\nBut according to standard sentiment analysis practices, if there are mixed sentiments without clear dominance, it might lean towards neutral. However, some systems might prioritize the negative part because it's a direct complaint. But I need to check the example given. The examples provided by the user include cases where both positive and negative are present but the label is either positive or negative. For instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as neutral. \n\nIn this case, since there are both positive and negative elements, but no clear dominance, maybe it's neutral. However, sometimes the presence of a complaint (negative) might make it negative. But I need to be careful here. The user is saying the product is high quality and arrived well, which are positives, but the lip plumper didn't work for them. Since the main product (lip plumper) didn't work, that's a negative point. However, the overall sentiment might depend on whether the user is satisfied with the product as a whole. \n\nBut since the user mentioned both positive and negative aspects without clear dominance, it's safer to label it as NEUTRAL. Alternatively, if the negative part is more significant (the main purpose of the product didn't work), then NEGATIVE. But I need to check the examples again.

The user is giving a warning about the product's condition upon arrival but still recommends repurchasing.

However, I need to check if the negatives outweigh the positives or vice versa. Since they mention both problems and benefits, it might be neutral. But sometimes, even with some negatives, if the user is still purchasing, it could lean positive. Wait, but the initial part about the product being rotten and causing bacteria is a significant negative point. However, the user's advice to remove it immediately suggests they're aware of the issue but still find value in the product. The fact that they are buying it again indicates satisfaction despite the problem. So maybe it's neutral because there are both negatives and positives. Alternatively, if the main recommendation is to use it despite the issues, maybe positive? Hmm. But the initial complaint about the product being rotten might be a strong negative. However, the user is still purchasing it again, which shows overall satisfaction. I think the key here is that the user acknowledges a problem but continues to recommend the product, leading to a neutral sentiment.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided the text: \"harika bir bb crem benim favorim\". I need to analyze this and determine the sentiment.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Harika\" means wonderful or great in Turkish, which is a positive word. Then \"bir bb crem\" refers to a BB cream, which is a skincare product. The phrase \"benim favorim\" translates to \"my favorite,\" indicating that the user likes it a lot.\n\nSo combining these parts: the user is saying that this BB cream is wonderful and their favorite. Both \"harika\" and \"favorim\" are strong positive indicators. There's no negative language here, just enthusiasm about the product. Even though there's no explicit mention of why it's great, the words used are clearly positive.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but in Turkish, sarcasm is often more context-dependent and might use different cues. Here, the straightforward positive adjectives make me confident it's a genuine compliment. No neutral terms either; the user isn't just stating a fact but expressing satisfaction.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The user provided the text: \"Yıllar önce kullandığım bir koku özlemişim.\" I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, translating the sentence: \"I have missed the scent I used years ago.\" The key words here are \"özlemişim,\" which means \"I have missed\" or \"I long for.\" Missing something usually has a nostalgic or longing feeling. But does that translate to positive, negative, or neutral?\n\nNostalgia can be bittersweet. However, in sentiment analysis, missing something is often considered negative because it's about a lack or absence. The person is expressing a desire for something they no longer have. So \"özlemek\" (to miss) is generally associated with negative emotions here.\n\nBut wait, sometimes people might feel positively about memories. But the verb \"özlemek\" itself is more about longing and missing, which leans towards negative. Also, the context doesn't mention any positive aspects of the memory, just the absence. So I think this should be labeled as NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The user mentions \"Kokusu çok güzel\" which translates to \"The smell is very nice.\" That's clearly a positive statement. Then they say \"avonun parfümlerini çok beğeniyorm zaten\" meaning \"I really like Avon's perfumes anyway.\" The word \"beğeniyorm\" is the present continuous form of \"to like,\" so it's expressing a current preference. Words like \"çok güzel\" and \"çok beğeniyorm\" are strong positive indicators.\n\nThere's no negative language here. The user is expressing satisfaction with both the scent and the brand's perfumes. Even the phrase \"zaten\" (anyway) doesn't introduce any negativity; it might just be emphasizing their existing preference. \n\nSo, combining these elements, the sentiment is definitely positive.

But since they mention returning the item, that's a strong indicator of dissatisfaction. Then \"kolları tuhaf durduğu\" translates to \"the sleeves are weirdly positioned,\" which is clearly a negative comment about the product's fit or design.\n\nThe user took action by returning the garment, which is a clear sign of a negative experience. Even though \"çok bol\" might be neutral on its own, combined with the issue about the sleeves and the return, the overall sentiment is negative.

The next part says the scent isn't lasting at all (\"hiç mi hiç kalıcı değil\") and changes as it dries (\"ilk sıkılan koku uçtukça değişiyor\"). These are negative points because the product's fragrance doesn't last, which is a common complaint in reviews.\n\nSo there's a mix of positive and negative aspects. However, the overall sentiment might lean more towards negative because the main issue here is that the scent isn't lasting, which could be a significant drawback for someone buying the product. Even though they liked the initial smell, the fact that it doesn't last long enough makes the experience less satisfying.

All these are negative outcomes.\n\nIn Turkish, \"hiçbir faydası yok\" is a strong negative statement. The use of \"artı\" here seems to be listing additional negative effects, which reinforces the negative sentiment. Words like \"saç döküyor\" (causing hair loss) and \"kurutuyor\" (drying out) are clearly negative.\n\nThe user might be reviewing a product, maybe a shampoo or a skincare product, and expressing dissatisfaction. The overall tone is definitely negative, with no positive aspects mentioned.

This usually conveys surprise or fear, but in this context, since the user is saying they don't recommend something, the emoji might be emphasizing their negative experience.\n\nSo combining the explicit statement of not recommending and the emoji, the sentiment here is clearly negative.

The phrase \"fena değil\" translates to \"not bad,\" which is a positive remark. However, there's a part about \"çizgi çizgi yapıyor,\" which might mean they're working in a fragmented or incomplete way. But the user is saying that despite that, the price is reasonable.\n\nSo even though there's a mention of something not being perfect (\"çizgi çizgi\"), the overall sentiment is positive because they're acknowledging the value for money. The key here is that the negative aspect (the work being done in parts) is outweighed by the positive comment on the price. \n\nI should check if there are any other nuances. Maybe \"çizgi çizgi\" could be neutral, but combined with \"fiyata göre fena değil,\" it's more about the value. So the overall sentiment leans positive.

The user starts with \"10/10 ürün\" which is a high rating, so that's positive. Then \"çok güzel temizliyor\" means it cleans very well, another positive point. \"Beklentimin ustunde geldi\" translates to exceeding expectations, which is definitely positive. \"Gucu yerinde\" suggests the power is adequate, neutral maybe?

They mention \"kaçmaz\" which might be a typo for \"kalmaz\" (doesn't stay) or \"kaçar\" (runs away). Then they say \"okadar bekledim fiyati\" meaning they waited so long for the price. After they bought it, the price dropped (\"dustu\" is probably \"düştü\", meaning fell).\n\nSo the user is expressing frustration because they waited for a good price, bought it, and then saw it drop.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, the key words here are \"biraz fazla\" meaning \"a bit too much\" and \"nane kokusu\" which is \"mint smell.\" The phrase \"fazla\" usually indicates excess, which can be negative. However, the context matters. If someone mentions a mint smell, it could be positive if they like mint, but here it's paired with \"fazla,\" suggesting it's more than desired.\n\nThe user might be talking about a product, maybe food or a drink that has an excessive mint flavor. The use of \"biraz\" softens the criticism, making it less harsh but still negative. Alternatively, if the person is neutral, they might just be stating a fact without strong feelings. But since there's an implication that the amount is too much, which is a negative connotation, I think this leans towards NEGATIVE.\n\nWait, but sometimes people might find a minty smell pleasant even if it's strong.

Then they mention the brushes are too small (\"farlar çok küçük fırça bile zor alıyor\" – \"the brushes are too small, even hard to pick up\"), which sounds negative. Next, they say \"bu kadar beklemiyorum\" – \"I wasn't expecting this much,\" which could be neutral or slightly negative depending on context. However, the last part is \"fiyatına göre mükemmel\" – \"perfect for the price,\" which is positive.\n\nSo there's a mix of positive and negative points. The user is expressing both satisfaction with the color and price but dissatisfaction with the brush size. Since the overall sentiment isn't clearly dominated by one emotion, the neutral label might be appropriate here. But I need to check if the positives outweigh the negatives or vice versa. The mention of \"mükemmel\" (perfect) in relation to the price is a strong positive, while the negative about the brush size is a specific issue.

The user wrote, \"Fena değil ama bayılmadım.\" Translating that to English, it's something like \"Not bad, but I didn't pass out.\" \n\nFirst, \"Fena değil\" is a common phrase in Turkish that means \"not bad\" or \"okay.\" That part sounds neutral or slightly positive. But then there's the second part: \"ama bayılmadım,\" which translates to \"but I didn't pass out.\" The word \"bayılmak\" means to faint or pass out, so not doing that could be seen as a positive outcome if the context is something like an illness or a scary situation.\n\nHowever, the overall sentiment here seems mixed. The first part is neutral/positive, but the second part might imply that there was some concern or expectation of passing out, which didn't happen. But since the user didn't express any negative emotions explicitly, just stating that they didn't pass out, it's more of a neutral statement. \n\nWait, maybe \"fena değil\" is positive enough to tip the scale towards positive? But the second part doesn't add much negativity either. It's more about not experiencing something bad. So combining both parts, the sentiment might lean slightly positive because they're saying it's not bad and they avoided a negative outcome. However, some might argue that \"ama\" (but) introduces a contrast, but since there's no explicit negative emotion, maybe it's still neutral.\n\nHmm, I think in this case, the overall sentiment is more neutral. The user isn't expressing strong positive or negative feelings. They're just stating two facts: it's not bad and they didn't pass out.

That's a positive sentiment because they had high expectations.

The text is: \"Kullanım aşamasındayım güzele benziyor ama fırca kısmı çok yumuşak\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context and the emotions expressed here. The person is in the usage phase (\"Kullanım aşamasındayım\") which might indicate they're currently using the product. They say \"güzele benziyor\" which translates to \"looks good\" or \"seems nice,\" so that's a positive note.\n\nBut then there's an \"ama\" (but), which introduces a contrast. The next part is \"fırca kısmı çok yumuşak\" meaning \"the brush part is very soft.\" Now, whether this is positive or negative depends on context. If the product is supposed to have a firm brush, being too soft might be a problem. However, if it's a cosmetic product like a makeup brush, a soft brush could be a good thing. But since the user didn't specify, I need to consider common scenarios.\n\nIn many cases, especially with products like toothbrushes or cleaning tools, a very soft bristle might be seen as a negative if they're not effective. However, in other contexts, it's positive. Since the user is using it and says \"güzele benziyor,\" maybe they are satisfied overall but have a minor concern about the brush's firmness.\n\nBut the key here is that the user is pointing out a specific issue (\"çok yumuşak\") which could be a negative aspect if it's not meeting their expectations. However, without more context, it's tricky. The presence of both positive and negative elements makes me think the sentiment might be neutral because they're expressing both satisfaction and a concern.\n\nWait, but in Turkish, sometimes \"yumuşak\" can be positive depending on the product. For example, if it's a skincare tool, soft bristles are good. But since the user didn't specify, maybe the overall sentiment is neutral as they mention both positive and negative aspects without clear dominance.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

However, sometimes neutral can be used if it's mixed. But in this case, the user is pointing out specific issues which might lean more towards negative. Alternatively, since there are both positive and negative elements, maybe NEUTRAL? Wait, but the example given for NEUTRAL was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is more of a neutral comment about price.

The text is: \"indirimden çok uyguna lmistim çok fazla bir beklentiniz olmasin ama güzel kokuyor\". First, I need to understand what the user is saying here.\n\nBreaking it down, the first part is \"indirimden çok uyguna lmistim\" which translates to something like \"I was very happy with the discount\" or \"I found it very cheap due to the discount.\" The next part is \"çok fazla bir beklentiniz olmasin\" meaning \"don't have too high expectations\" or \"don't expect too much.\" Then, \"ama güzel kokuyor\" which is \"but it smells good\" or \"but it's pleasant.\"\n\nSo the user is talking about a product they bought on sale. They mention being happy with the price but also cautioning others not to have high expectations. However, they end by saying that it smells good, which is a positive note. \n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The initial part is positive because they're happy about the discount. Then there's a neutral or slightly negative part where they advise against high expectations, maybe indicating that the product isn't perfect. But the last part is positive again with \"güzel kokuyor.\" \n\nBut how do these parts balance out? The user might be expressing mixed feelings. However, in sentiment analysis, if there are both positive and neutral elements without strong negative language, it might lean towards neutral. Alternatively, since the overall tone isn't strongly negative, maybe it's still positive. Wait, but the caution about expectations could imply some dissatisfaction. \n\nWait, the user says \"çok fazla bir beklentiniz olmasin\" which is a warning not to have high expectations. That might suggest that the product doesn't meet high standards, so that part is negative. However, they also mention the good smell, which is positive. So there's a mix of positive and negative elements. But in sentiment analysis, if the overall sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative, it's neutral. \n\nBut I need to check the example given. For instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. That's a neutral statement. In this case, the user has both positive and cautionary (maybe slightly negative) parts. However, since there's no strong negative language, maybe it's still neutral. Alternatively, if the positive aspects outweigh the caution, but the caution is more about expectations than actual dissatisfaction. \n\nAlternatively, the user might be saying that despite the discount, they don't expect much, but the product is pleasant in smell. So the overall sentiment could be positive because the main point is that it's a good deal and smells nice, with the caution being a minor note. But I'm not sure. Maybe the caution implies some reservation, making it neutral. \n\nHmm. In Turkish, \"çok fazla bir beklentiniz olmasin\" might be more of a warning rather than expressing dissatisfaction. So maybe the user is just advising others not to expect too much, but still finds the product acceptable (since it smells good). Therefore, the sentiment could be positive because they are satisfied with the purchase despite the caution. \n\nBut I need to make sure. The key here is whether the overall tone is more positive, negative, or neutral. Since there's a mix of positive (\"indirimden çok uyguna\", \"güzel kokuyor\") and a neutral/cautious part, but no strong negatives, maybe it's still positive. However, sometimes in sentiment analysis, if there are both positive and negative elements, it might be neutral. But the examples given by the user have cases where mixed sentiments can lead to neutral. \n\nWait, looking at the example: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is NEUTRAL. That's a balanced statement. In this case, the user has both positive aspects (happy with discount, good smell) and a cautionary note (don't expect too much). So maybe it's more neutral because there's a mix of positive and cautious elements without strong negatives. Alternatively, if the caution is considered a negative, but not strongly so, then maybe it's still positive. \n\nI think in this case, since the user is expressing satisfaction with the price and the product's smell, even though they advise against high expectations, the overall sentiment leans more towards positive. The caution might be a minor point, not a strong negative. Therefore, the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Even though there's a positive note, the problem with the product (charging) and the decision to return it lean more towards negative.

The user starts by saying the product's scent is very pleasant (\"çok hoş\"), which is a positive point. Then they mention that after washing, there's some stiffness (\"biraz sertlik oluyor\"), which is a negative aspect. They also say it doesn't make the skin completely soft (\"tam yumuşak yapmıyor\"), another negative point. However, they end with \"güzel temizliyor,\" meaning it cleans well, which is positive.\n\nSo there are both positive and negative elements here. The positives are the pleasant scent and effective cleaning. The negatives are the stiffness after washing and not making the skin fully soft.

The thumbs down emoji reinforces the negative sentiment. Even though the first part might be neutral or even slightly positive if \"sert\" (hard) is a good quality, the second part clearly expresses dissatisfaction.

The first part is \"Çok güzel bir jel.\" which translates to \"A very beautiful gel.\" The word \"çok güzel\" is clearly positive.\n\nNext, \"Tertemiz yapıyor cildi.\" means \"It cleanses the skin.\" The verb \"tertemiz yapmak\" implies making something clean or clear, which is a positive effect on the skin.\n\nThen, \"Denemediğim ürün kalmamıştı\" translates to \"There was no product left that I hadn't tried.\" This might be a bit confusing. It could mean the user has tried almost all products, but it's not directly negative or positive. However, the following sentence is important: \"Yüzümü çok iyi geldi.\" which means \"It worked very well on my face.\" The phrase \"çok iyi geldi\" is a strong positive indicator.\n\nPutting it all together, the user is expressing satisfaction with the product's effectiveness and quality.

They end with \"tavsiye etmem\" meaning \"I wouldn't recommend it.\"\n\nSo, the key points are negative feelings towards the product's smell, disappointment compared to reviews, and a recommendation against purchasing.

The key here is that the user hasn't used the product yet. They mention \"bir fikrim yok\" which means \"I don't have an opinion.\" That suggests neutrality because there's no positive or negative experience to base a sentiment on. They're just stating they haven't used it and are about to try it for the first time. \n\nThe tags available are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. Since there's no indication of satisfaction or dissatisfaction, but rather an absence of opinion due to lack of experience, the correct label should be NEUTRAL.

They use phrases like \"bir işe yaramadı\" which translates to \"didn't work at all\" or \"was useless\". The repetition of \"yine\" (again) suggests frustration or disappointment.\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"işe yaramadı\" is negative.

The text is: \"Elime çabuk ulaştı şampuanın yapısı hoş fakat kokusu kötü onun dışında saçlarımı sertleştirdi biraz\". \n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence. The user starts with \"Elime çabuk ulaştı\" which translates to \"It arrived quickly to me.\" That's a positive point about delivery speed.\n\nNext, \"şampuanın yapısı hoş\" means \"the structure of the shampoo is nice,\" so that's another positive aspect.\n\nThen there's \"fakat kokusu kötü\" which is \"but the smell is bad.\" Here, \"fakat\" introduces a negative point about the scent.\n\nFollowing that, \"onun dışında saçlarımı sertleştirdi biraz\" translates to \"other than that, it made my hair a bit stiff.\" This is another negative comment regarding the effect on hair texture.\n\nNow, considering all parts: there are two positives (quick delivery, nice structure) and two negatives (bad smell, makes hair stiff). The user seems to have mixed feelings. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a mix, it might lean towards neutral unless one side is significantly stronger. But here, the negatives are about product quality, which might be more impactful than the positives about delivery and structure. However, the user also mentions \"biraz\" (a bit) for the hair stiffness, which softens that negative point. \n\nBut according to the rules, if there's a mix of positive and negative, but no clear dominance, it's neutral. Alternatively, if the negatives are more significant, it could be negative. However, in this case, since both positives and negatives are present without clear dominance, the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The text says: \"ürünün boyutu küçük ama zaten c vitaminleri gitgide etkisini yitirmeye basliyor boylesi daha iyi indirimde fiyati çok uygun yuze canlilik getiriyor.\"\n\nBreaking it down, the user mentions that the product's size is small (\"ürünün boyutu küçük\"), which could be a negative point. However, they then say \"ama zaten c vitaminleri gitgide etkisini yitirmeye basliyor\" – here, they're talking about C vitamins losing their effectiveness over time, which might be a negative aspect. But the next part is \"boylesi daha iyi indirimde fiyati çok uygun\" – so they mention that despite the size, it's on sale and the price is very reasonable (\"fiyati çok uygun\"), which is positive. Finally, \"yuze canlilik getiriyor\" suggests that it provides a fresh or lively feeling, another positive point.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The text has both negative and positive elements. However, the overall tone seems to lean towards positive because the user is highlighting the benefits of the price and the effect on freshness despite the size issue. The mention of C vitamins losing effectiveness might be a drawback, but it's balanced by the cost-effectiveness and the positive outcome of \"canlilik getiriyor.\" \n\nI need to check if there's a clear dominance of one sentiment over the other. Since the user is pointing out a negative aspect (small size, vitamins losing effect) but then emphasizing the positives (discounted price, good value, freshness), it might be neutral. However, sometimes in such cases, the overall sentiment can still be positive if the positives outweigh the negatives. But since there are both positive and negative points without a clear dominance, NEUTRAL might be appropriate here. Alternatively, if the user is satisfied despite the drawbacks, it could be POSITIVE. \n\nBut looking at the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. So when there's a mix of positive and negative but no clear overall sentiment, NEUTRAL is used. In this case, the user mentions both downsides (small size, vitamins losing effect) and upsides (good price, freshness). Therefore, it's a balanced view without a strong positive or negative sentiment. Hence, the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The key here is that despite the initial hesitation, the user ends up being very satisfied. Since the overall experience is positive and the final judgment is \"mükemmel bir ürün\" (perfect product), the dominant emotion is positive. Even though there's a mention of difficulty, the main sentiment is positive.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Ancak dikey raflar kullanılabilir.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The user is talking about shelves. They mention that the horizontal shelves are too small and that an A4 paper doesn't fit, which sounds negative. But then they say \"Ancak dikey raflar kullanılabilir,\" meaning vertical shelves can be used. So there's a contrast here.\n\nThe first part is clearly negative because the user is complaining about the size of the horizontal shelves not meeting expectations (A4 not fitting). However, the second part is positive because they mention that vertical shelves are usable. But wait, the overall sentiment might depend on which part is more emphasized. \n\nBut in Turkish reviews, sometimes even if there's a positive note, the main issue is the negative aspect. The user is pointing out a problem with the product (horizontal shelves not being big enough), which is a significant drawback. The mention of vertical shelves being usable might be a mitigating factor but doesn't fully negate the negative experience. \n\nSo, considering that the primary complaint is about the horizontal shelves not meeting expectations, and the positive part is just an additional note, the overall sentiment leans more towards negative. However, some might argue it's neutral because there's both criticism and a positive point. But in most cases, if a product has a major flaw (like not fitting A4), that's a strong negative point. The fact that vertical shelves are usable is a partial solution but doesn't make the overall experience positive. Therefore, I think the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user wrote: \"ürün güzel ama alerjik yapti kardesime bende bir sorun olmadi hassas cildler dikkat etsin\". Translating that to English: \"The product is nice but it caused an allergy in my sibling, I didn't have any problem, sensitive skin should be careful.\"\n\nFirst, the user starts by saying the product is good (\"ürün güzel\"), which is a positive point. However, they mention that their sibling had an allergic reaction (\"alerjik yapti kardesime\"), which is negative. Then they say they themselves didn't have any issues (\"bende bir sorun olmadi\"), which is neutral. Finally, they warn sensitive skin to be careful (\"hassas cildler dikkat etsin\"), which is a cautionary note but not directly positive or negative.\n\nNow, considering the overall sentiment. The product has both positive and negative aspects. But in sentiment analysis, if there's a mix, we often look for the dominant emotion. However, the presence of a negative experience (allergy) might tip it towards negative. But the user also mentions they didn't have a problem. However, the fact that it caused an allergy in someone else could be seen as a significant negative point. On the other hand, the product being \"güzel\" is positive. \n\nBut in many cases, when there's both positive and negative elements, especially if the negative part is about safety or health (allergy), that might override the positive aspect. However, sometimes it's neutral because it's a mixed experience. But the instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. \n\nWait, the example given for \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was NEUTRAL. So if there's both positive and negative elements without clear dominance, maybe it's neutral. However, in this case, the user is warning others about potential allergies, which might be a strong negative factor. But they also say the product is good. \n\nHmm. It's tricky. The presence of an allergy could make it more negative, but the positive comment balances it. However, in some contexts, even if there's a positive and negative, if the negative is about safety or harm, that might be considered more negative. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the user had no problem themselves, maybe it's neutral because they're giving a mixed review with both pros and cons. \n\nBut the instruction says to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. If there's a mix, but no clear dominance, then NEUTRAL might be appropriate. However, sometimes in such cases, if the negative part is significant (like causing an allergy), it could be considered more negative. But I need to check the examples again. \n\nLooking back at the examples: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" -> POSITIVE. \"Zehirlendim.\" -> NEGATIVE. \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" -> NEUTRAL. So, in the third example, it's neutral because it's a balanced statement about price. Similarly, here, the user is saying the product is good but caused an allergy in someone else. The fact that they themselves didn't have a problem might make it more neutral. However, the warning to sensitive skin could be seen as a negative aspect. \n\nBut I think the key here is that the user's own experience was positive (no problem), but there's a cautionary note for others. So maybe the overall sentiment is mixed, leading to NEUTRAL. Alternatively, if the presence of an allergy in someone else is considered a strong negative, even though the user didn't have it, then NEGATIVE. But I'm not sure. \n\nIn some cases, when there's both positive and negative elements without clear dominance, NEUTRAL is used. So perhaps here, since the product was good but caused an issue for another person, leading to a warning, it's NEUTRAL. However, others might argue that the negative aspect (allergy) makes it NEGATIVE. \n\nBut considering the examples given, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral because it's a balanced statement about price. Similarly, here, the user has both positive and negative points but ends with a warning. So maybe NEUTRAL is appropriate.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The emoji 😇 at the end might indicate a positive feeling.\n\nNow, looking at the keywords: \"soğuk\" (cold), \"rahatlatıyor\" (relaxes), \"bağımlılık yaptı\" (caused addiction/dependency), \"nemlendiriciyi bile bununla sürüyorum\" (I even use this instead of moisturizer). The words like \"rahatlatıyor\" and the fact that they're using it in place of a regular product suggest satisfaction. However, \"bağımlılık\" could be negative, but in context, it's more about dependency on the product's benefits rather than a bad addiction. The overall tone seems positive because the user is highlighting the product's effectiveness and comfort.\n\nI should check if there are any negative words. \"Sürekli soğuk oluyor\" might sound negative, but since it's a natural stone and they're using it for massage, the coldness is a feature they like.

The first part is \"güzel bir ürün\" which translates to \"a beautiful product.\" That's clearly positive.\n\nNext, \"hızlı emiliyor\" means \"absorbs quickly.\" Depending on context, this could be positive or negative. If it's a skincare product, quick absorption might be good. But the user didn't specify, so I'll note that.\n\nThen there's \"çok bol surulmemesi gerekiyor,\" which translates to \"it needs to be applied in large amounts.\" This part sounds negative because it suggests the product isn't efficient or requires more usage than desired.\n\nPutting it all together: The user starts with a positive comment about the product being beautiful, but then mentions that it needs to be applied in large quantities, which is a drawback. However, there's no explicit negative word here. The overall sentiment might be neutral because the positives and negatives balance out, or maybe slightly negative due to the inconvenience of needing more application.\n\nBut wait, \"surulmemesi gerekiyor\" could mean that it's not necessary to apply much, but the phrase \"çok bol surulmemesi\" is a bit confusing. Maybe they meant that you don't need to apply a lot? Or maybe there's a typo. If it's supposed to be \"surulması gerekiyor,\" then it would mean \"needs to be applied,\" which might change things. But assuming the original text is correct, \"surulmemesi\" implies not needing to apply much. However, the user says \"çok bol surulmemesi gerekiyor,\" which could be a mistake in phrasing. Maybe they meant that it's necessary to apply a lot, making it negative.\n\nConsidering all this, the positive aspect is the product being good, but the need for frequent or large applications might be seen as a downside. However, without clear negative words like \"kötü\" or \"zor,\" it's tricky. The user might have mixed feelings, so neutral could be appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The first part mentions that the item is smaller than expected, which could be seen as a negative point. However, the second part says \"ama işe yaradı,\" which translates to \"but it worked.\" The use of \"ama\" (but) indicates a contrast between the initial disappointment and the positive outcome.\n\nSo, there's a mix of negative and positive elements. But in sentiment analysis, we have to look at the overall tone. Even though there's a complaint about size, the fact that it worked might outweigh that. However, the user is pointing out a flaw but also acknowledging functionality. \n\nLooking at the examples provided: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral because it's a balanced statement. Similarly, here, the user has both negative and positive aspects.

The main function was fulfilled, so the user might be satisfied enough to give a neutral rating. Alternatively, if the size was a significant issue, it could be negative. However, since they mention it's \"işe yaradı\" (worked), which is a positive outcome, but the size was a drawback.\n\nIn such cases, sometimes the sentiment is neutral because there are both positives and negatives.

The key words are \"hemen sonra\" (immediately after) and \"iyileştirdiğini hissedebilirsiniz\" (you can feel that it healed). The use of \"hemen sonra\" suggests a quick effect, which is usually positive. The verb \"iyileştirmek\" means to heal or cure, which is definitely a positive outcome.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there's any negative connotation. The sentence structure is straightforward and doesn't include any negative words like \"zehirli\" (poisonous) or \"kötü\" (bad). The user is talking about a product or treatment that works quickly, which is a positive attribute.\n\nHowever, sometimes in Turkish, depending on context, certain phrases might have different meanings. But here, the context seems clear. The person is expressing satisfaction with the quick healing effect. There's no ambiguity or sarcasm indicated. \n\nSo, considering all that, the sentiment should be positive.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, looking at the words: \"çok\" means \"very\" in Turkish, which is an intensifier. Then \"ufak\" translates to \"small\" or \"little\". The suffix \"-mış\" indicates a past tense or a realization. So the sentence is something like \"It was very small...\" \n\nNow, the context here is important. If someone says something was very small, that could be negative if they were expecting it to be bigger, but it might also be neutral depending on the situation. For example, if they're talking about a product's size and it's smaller than expected, that's negative. But if they're just stating a fact without any emotional context, it might be neutral.\n\nHowever, in Turkish, when people use \"çok ufakmış\" with the suffix \"-mış\", it often implies a sense of disappointment or surprise at how small something is. The ellipsis at the end also suggests hesitation or uncertainty, which leans towards a negative sentiment. \n\nI should check if there's any positive connotation here. \"Ufak\" isn't inherently positive or negative; it's just a descriptor. But combined with \"çok\" and the context of realization, it's more likely to be negative. The user might be expressing dissatisfaction with something being smaller than expected.\n\nSo, considering all that, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user wrote, \"güzel alıyor ama yüzü çok kızartiyor.\" Translating that to English, it's something like \"She buys nice things but her face is very red.\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment here. The first part, \"güzel alıyor\" (she buys nice things) sounds positive. But then there's \"ama\" which means \"but,\" indicating a contrast. The second part, \"yüzü çok kızartiyor\" (her face is very red), could be negative. However, in Turkish, \"kızartmak\" can sometimes mean to make something look better, like applying makeup or using skincare products. So maybe the person is saying that even though she buys nice things, her face looks too made up or artificial.\n\nBut wait, \"kızartmak\" can also mean to burn or scorch, but in the context of a face, it's more likely about makeup. However, the use of \"çok\" (very) might indicate excessiveness. So the sentiment here is mixed. The first part is positive, the second part could be negative or neutral depending on interpretation.\n\nBut according to the rules, I have to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there's a contrast, but the overall tone isn't clearly positive or negative. However, the presence of \"ama\" (but) might tip it towards negative because the second part is pointing out a flaw despite the first part being positive. But if \"kızartmak\" here is neutral, like applying makeup, then maybe it's just a statement without strong sentiment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is criticizing her for overdoing the makeup, making it look unnatural. That would be negative. However, without more context, it's tricky. The safest bet might be NEUTRAL because it's a mixed statement with both positive and negative elements, but not strongly leaning either way.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The words used are positive: \"iyi\" is clearly positive, and \"çok\" intensifies it. There's no negative language here. The sentence is straightforward praise about a scent. So the label should be POSITIVE.\n\nI need to make sure there's no hidden sarcasm or context I'm missing. But since the user didn't mention any additional context, I'll go with the literal meaning. No neutral words here either. The sentiment is clearly positive.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The user wrote, \"Farlar en ufak darbede kırılıyor ama pigmenti güzel.\" Translating that to English, it's something like, \"The lights break with the slightest impact but the pigment is nice.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The sentence has two parts connected by \"ama,\" which means \"but\" in Turkish. The first part talks about the lights breaking easily, which sounds negative. The second part mentions the pigment being good, which is positive.\n\nNow, the challenge is determining which part dominates the overall sentiment. The user is pointing out a flaw (fragility) but also a positive aspect (good pigment). However, in product reviews, if there's a significant drawback mentioned alongside a positive note, the negative aspect might take precedence unless the positive is strongly emphasized. \n\nBut here, the structure is \"negative point but positive point.\" The use of \"ama\" often introduces a contrast, but it doesn't necessarily mean the overall sentiment is neutral. It depends on context. If the product's main function is related to the pigment, then the negative might be less impactful. However, if the fragility is a major issue, that could overshadow the positive.\n\nLooking at the example given in the instructions: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" translates to \"Okay for the price,\" which is neutral. So, when there's a mix of positive and negative but no clear dominance, it's neutral. In this case, the user mentions both a flaw and a good point. Since neither seems to dominate strongly, the sentiment might be neutral. However, sometimes the presence of a negative aspect can make it more negative, but the example shows that when there's a balance, it's neutral.\n\nSo, considering the structure and examples, I think the label here should be \"NEUTRAL\" because it's pointing out both a downside and an upside without clear emphasis on either.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

That might be a negative point because they're not happy with the level of shine.\n\nPutting this together, the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's effectiveness (no growth) and its appearance (too shiny).

Next, they say something about colored hair being opened (\"boyalı saçları bile açıyor\"), and then \"oreal var galiba\" which might be a brand name or a typo.\n\nLooking at the sentiment words: \"alıyorum\" is neutral, just stating an action. \"Çok koyu oluyor\" could be negative because it's pointing out a problem with the color being too dark. However, the user also mentions that the product opens colored hair, which might be a positive or negative point depending on context. But since they're talking about a product (maybe hair dye), the fact that it can open colored hair might be a negative aspect if it's causing damage. The mention of \"oreal\" could be a brand name, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nHowever, the overall sentiment seems mixed. There's a complaint about the color being too dark and possibly damaging hair, which leans towards negative. But there's no strong positive or negative words that dominate. However, in Turkish, \"boyalı saçları bile açıyor\" might be referring to the product's ability to open up colored hair, which could be seen as a positive if it's about effectiveness, but negative if it's causing damage. The user is unsure (\"galiba\"), so they're not certain.\n\nConsidering all that, the sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative. It has elements of both but no strong indicators.

The user wrote: \"ürün güzel fakat boyu bayağı küçüşk fotoğrafdakilere aldanmayın avuç içü kadar boyu var paketleme güzeldi\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the sentiment here. The user starts by saying \"ürün güzel\" which means \"the product is nice\" – that's positive. But then they use \"fakat\" which is \"but,\" indicating a contrast. They mention the size is \"bayağı küçüşk\" (very small) and warn others not to be deceived by the photos, saying the size is like the palm of your hand. That part sounds negative because they're pointing out a disappointment with the product's size.\n\nHowever, they also say \"paketleme güzeldi\" meaning \"the packaging was nice,\" which is another positive point. So there are both positive and negative aspects here. But in sentiment analysis, we usually look at the overall tone. The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product's size despite liking the product and packaging. \n\nThe key here is whether the negatives outweigh the positives or vice versa. The initial positive comment about the product is countered by the negative about the size, which seems to be a significant issue. However, the user also mentions the packaging was good. But since the main product aspect (size) is criticized, the overall sentiment might lean more towards negative. \n\nBut wait, sometimes in such cases, if there are mixed sentiments, it's neutral. However, the presence of both positive and negative elements can make it tricky. The user is giving a warning about the size, which could be seen as a strong negative point. But they also liked the product and packaging. However, the main issue here is the discrepancy between the photo and the actual product size, leading to disappointment. \n\nIn many sentiment analysis models, if there's a clear positive and negative aspect but no clear dominance, it might be neutral. However, in this case, the user is pointing out a significant flaw (size) which could make the overall sentiment more negative. But since they also mention positives, maybe it's neutral. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the example given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. That's a balanced statement. Similarly here, the user has both positive and negative points. The main product aspect (size) is negative, but other aspects are positive. However, the overall experience might be mixed. But in some cases, if the negative part is about the product's core attribute (size), that could make it more negative. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is trying to say that despite the good packaging and the product being nice, the size was an issue. So the sentiment isn't entirely negative but has both elements. However, in the examples provided by the user, when there are mixed sentiments, like \"Fiyatına göre okey,\" it's neutral. Similarly here, since there are both positive and negative points without a clear dominance, maybe it should be NEUTRAL.\n\nBut I need to check again.

Words like \"hüsrana uğradım\" (I was disappointed) and \"yanlış mı kullanıyorum\" (am I using it wrong?) show negative emotions.

The user says: \"Ürün küçük diyenleri gerçekten hiç anlamadim nasıl bir kafadalar gayet fazla miktari var ve ilk kullanimda bile tırnaklarıma iyi geldi.\" Translating that to English: \"I really don't understand people who say the product is small, what's their mindset? There's a lot of quantity, and even on the first use, it was good for my nails.\"\n\nBreaking it down, the user is responding to negative comments about the product size.

Also, they note that even on the first use, it was beneficial for their nails (\"ilk kullanimda bile tırnaklarıma iyi geldi\"), which is another positive point.\n\nSo the sentiment here seems to be positive because the user is countering negative feedback with their own positive experience.

The phrase \"hır ürün 2\" might be a typo or a specific term, but even if it's a product name, the following part is important: \"Kullanımdan sonra fark ortada\" which means \"After using it, the difference is clear\". That suggests that the user noticed a significant improvement or effect after using the product.\n\nPutting this together, the user is expressing strong positive sentiment towards the product. Words like \"kesinlikle\" and \"muhteşem\" are very positive indicators. Even though there's a part about noticing a difference after use, that's more of a neutral observation but in context, it's reinforcing the positive experience. There's no negative language here.

The user wrote, \"Paketleme güzel onun dışında sıradan.\" Translating that to English, it's something like \"The packaging is nice, but otherwise ordinary.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The user starts by saying the packaging is good (\"güzel\"), which is a positive point. However, they follow up with \"onun dışında sıradan,\" meaning \"otherwise ordinary.\" That part sounds neutral or slightly negative because \"sıradan\" can imply that other aspects are just average or not impressive.\n\nNow, considering the overall sentiment. The first part is positive, but the second part is neutral. Since there's no strong negative language here, just a contrast between a positive aspect and the rest being average. In such cases, where there's a mix of positive and neutral elements without clear negativity, the label might lean towards neutral. But I need to check if the positive part is enough to tip it to positive or if the overall sentiment is more balanced.\n\nHowever, in some contexts, even if one part is positive and another is neutral, the presence of any positive element could make the whole sentiment positive. But I think here, since the user is pointing out that only the packaging is good and everything else is just average, it's more about a mixed experience but not strongly negative. The key is whether \"sıradan\" is considered negative enough to make the overall sentiment negative or if it's just neutral.\n\nIn Turkish, \"sıradan\" can mean ordinary, which isn't necessarily bad, but in some contexts, it might imply that there's no standout feature. However, since the user didn't use any strong negative words like \"kötü\" (bad) or \"memnun değilim\" (not satisfied), it's more of a neutral observation. \n\nSo combining both parts: positive on packaging, neutral on other aspects. The overall sentiment might be considered neutral because there's no clear dominance of positive or negative elements. Therefore, the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Recommending something to others is a strong positive indicator. People don't usually recommend things they're not happy with. \n\nPutting it all together, the user has been using the product for a long time and actively recommends it. There's no negative language here, just positive affirmations.

I hope it doesn't cause acne.\" \n\nSo the user is talking about a product they've recently started using. They mention that it feels a bit oily, which could be a negative aspect.

The mention of \"biraz yagli\" (a bit oily) might be a negative point, but they're not outright complaining. They're also hopeful, which could lean towards neutral because there's no strong positive or negative sentiment. The use of \"Umarim\" (I hope) indicates uncertainty rather than a clear positive or negative feeling.\n\nSo I think the best label here is NEUTRAL because the user isn't expressing strong dissatisfaction or satisfaction.

First, I need to understand the Turkish sentence. \"Sevdiğim\" means \"I love\" or \"I like,\" which is positive. \"Tatlı\" translates to \"sweet,\" which is also a positive adjective. \"Bir koku\" is \"a smell\" or \"an aroma.\" So putting it all together, the sentence is expressing that the person likes a sweet smell.\n\nNow, checking the rules: the response must be in JSON with the label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The example given for similar positive sentences uses \"POSITIVE,\" so this should be the same here. No negative words are present, and the overall sentiment is clearly positive.

Bence yeterince açıklayıcı oldu😉\". Translating this to English helps understand the sentiment better. The first part says, \"Once you've used it, you can't leave this brand again.\" That sounds positive because it's indicating loyalty and satisfaction with the product. The second part is \"In my opinion, it's already sufficiently explanatory,\" followed by a winking emoji. The emoji adds a friendly tone, reinforcing the positive sentiment.\n\nNow, looking for keywords: \"bırakamıyorsunuz\" (can't leave) implies strong satisfaction. \"Yeterince açıklayıcı oldu\" (sufficiently explanatory) suggests that the user found the information provided adequate, which is a positive remark. The use of the emoji 😉 adds a casual, positive nuance.\n\nI need to check if there's any negative connotation. Words like \"bırakamıyorsunuz\" might seem negative at first glance, but in context, it's about not wanting to leave the brand, which is a good thing. There are no explicit complaints or negative words here. The overall tone is enthusiastic and satisfied.\n\nSo, the sentiment is clearly positive. The user is expressing satisfaction with the product and the explanation provided. No neutral terms that might indicate indifference.

Then \"kullanımı hiç pratik değil\" means \"usage is not practical at all,\" another negative point.

The user wrote, \"a kalıcı değil ama kokusu çok güzel.\" Translating that to English, it's something like, \"It's not long-lasting, but the scent is very nice.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The sentence has two parts connected by \"ama,\" which means \"but.\" The first part is negative: \"a kalıcı değil\" (not long-lasting). The second part is positive: \"kokusu çok güzel\" (the scent is very nice).\n\nNow, the challenge is determining whether the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Since there's a contrast between the two parts, I need to see which part has more weight. The user is pointing out a drawback (not long-lasting) but then highlighting a strong positive aspect (very nice scent). \n\nIn many cases, when there's a contrast like this, the overall sentiment can be neutral if both aspects are equally weighted. However, sometimes the positive part might outweigh the negative, making it positive. But in this case, since the user mentions a specific negative point and then a positive one, but doesn't resolve which is more important, it might lean towards neutral. \n\nAlternatively, if the positive aspect is stronger, maybe it's positive. But \"çok güzel\" (very nice) is a strong positive, while \"kalıcı değil\" (not long-lasting) is a negative. However, without more context, it's hard to tell which is more significant. The user might be expressing that despite the negative aspect, the positive one is notable. \n\nBut according to standard sentiment analysis rules, when there are both positive and negative elements without clear emphasis on one over the other, it's often considered neutral. So I think the label here should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

That sounds negative. Words like \"hiçbir şekilde\" (not at all) and \"aşırı sıkıyor\" (excessively tight) indicate dissatisfaction or a problem. There's no positive language here, just complaints.

But \"kullamdigim\" seems like \"kullandığım\" (used). So maybe \"the product I used\". Then \"saclarim\" is \"my hair\". The next part: \"bu ürün sayesinde kendine geldi\" – \"thanks to this product, it regained its health\" or something like that. Finally, \"teşekkürler ederim\" means \"I thank you\".\n\nSo the user is talking about a product they used for their hair, and thanks to the product, their hair has recovered.

Maybe they're referring to using it in a natural or herbal way, which could be positive if they're into that.\n\nBut wait, \"bitkisel diye kullanıyorum\" translates to \"I use it as a plant.\" That might mean they're using it for its botanical properties, like in essential oils or something similar. The strong smell could be a characteristic of the plant, so maybe they're not complaining about it. However, the context isn't entirely clear. If the product is supposed to have a strong scent and they're using it as a plant, perhaps it's neutral because they're just stating a fact without expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is saying that the smell is too strong for their liking but they still use it as a plant, that might lean negative.

However, sometimes people might just be informing without expressing dissatisfaction. \n\nWait, but in the examples given, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. So if someone says something is not what they expected, that might be negative. But if they're just stating a fact without emotion, it could be neutral.

Since the example where something is not as expected was considered neutral (\"Fiyatına göre okey\"), maybe this is similar. However, in that case, the user was okay with the price.

The phrase \"paslanmaz işe idare eder\" might mean \"stainless steel is sufficient for the job\" or \"the stainless part handles the work\".\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"paslanmaz\" means stainless, which is a positive attribute. \"İşе idare eder\" could be interpreted as \"sufficient for the job\" or \"handles the task\", which sounds neutral or slightly positive.

The person didn't use the product on their face because they stayed indoors, but they tried it on their hands. They mention that it felt like a moisturizer and had a nice smell.\n\nThe key positive points are \"nemlendirici gibi\" (like a moisturizer) and \"güzel kokuyordu\" (had a nice smell). These are positive descriptors. However, the user didn't use it on their face, which might be a negative point, but they didn't express dissatisfaction. They just mentioned they tried it on their hands and liked the scent and texture.\n\nThere's no strong negative language here. The overall tone seems neutral to slightly positive because they found the product pleasant when used on their hands, even though they didn't use it on their face. The absence of negative words and the presence of positive adjectives lean towards a positive sentiment, but since the main intended use (face) wasn't tested, maybe neutral? Wait, but they still had a good experience with the part they did use. Hmm.\n\nIn Turkish, \"bide\" at the end might be a filler word, not affecting sentiment. The main points are the positive aspects of the product's smell and texture on hands. So I think it's more positive than neutral. But maybe the user is just sharing an experience without strong feelings. However, the positive adjectives are clear. So probably POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Even though there's no explicit emotional language like \"angry\" or \"disappointed,\" the situation described is negative.\n\nI need to make sure there's no ambiguity here. The main issue is the damaged product leading to a return. There's no positive aspect mentioned, and while it's not overly negative, the action taken (returning) points towards dissatisfaction.

Then \"kargolama\" refers to shipping or delivery. The user mentions that when they placed the order, it was already in transit (\"siparişi verdiğim gün kargodaydı\"), which might be neutral or positive depending on context. Finally, \"teşekkürler\" means \"thank you,\" which is definitely a positive expression.\n\nPutting this together, the user is expressing satisfaction with the fast shipping and is thanking the service. The key positive words here are \"süper hızlı\" and \"teşekkürler.\" There's no negative language used. Even though the part about the order being in transit on the day it was placed might be neutral, the overall sentiment is clearly positive due to the emphasis on speed and gratitude.\n\nI need to make sure there's no hidden sarcasm or context I'm missing.

The key words here are \"etkisini görebiliyorsunuz\" (you can see its effect) and \"hiç düşünmeden alabilirsiniz\" (you can buy it without thinking). These phrases suggest a positive experience because the product is effective enough that you don't need to think twice about buying it. \n\nThe user might be talking about a product that works immediately, which is a good thing.

They end with \"kullanamıyorum,\" meaning they can't use it, which is definitely negative.\n\nSo even though there's a slightly positive adjective at the beginning, the overall sentiment is negative because the main issue is that the product doesn't work for them due to the color being too light.

Then \"parasına göre iyi\" means good for the price, which is a positive statement. But since they're comparing it to the price, maybe there's some expectation of value here.\n\nWait, but in Turkish, when someone says something is good for the price, they might be implying that it's acceptable or meets expectations, but not necessarily exceeding them. So the overall sentiment could be neutral because they're acknowledging it's not bad and it's good for the money, but maybe not overwhelmingly positive.\n\nBut I need to check the rules again. The labels are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. If there's a mix of positive and neutral elements, which one takes precedence? The example given for \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was NEUTRAL.

But I think in these cases, when people say something is good for the price, they're often expressing a neutral to slightly positive sentiment, but not strongly positive.

Let me break it down.\n\nThe first part, \"Kötü Göründüğü gibi değil\" translates to \"It's not as bad as it looks.\" That usually would be a positive statement because they're saying the product isn't as bad as it appears. But then the second part is \"almayın,\" which means \"don't buy it.\" So the user is advising against purchasing despite the initial impression.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. The first part might lean towards positive, but the overall message is a recommendation not to buy, which is negative. In sentiment analysis, the overall intent usually takes precedence. Even though there's a positive element in the first part, the action suggested (not buying) is negative. So the dominant sentiment here is likely negative. But I need to make sure there's no ambiguity. The user might be trying to say that even though it looks bad, they don't recommend buying it. Wait, maybe the structure is different. Let me check again.\n\nThe original Turkish sentence: \"Kötü Göründüğü gibi değil almayın.\" Maybe the correct parsing is \"It's not as bad as it seems, don't buy it.\" So the first part is a positive remark about the product's appearance, but the second part is a negative recommendation. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a clear instruction or opinion that contradicts the initial statement, the overall sentiment might be determined by the action suggested. But sometimes, the presence of both positive and negative elements can lead to neutral. Wait, but the user is advising against buying, which is a strong negative sentiment. Even though they say it's not as bad as it looks, the main message is not to buy, so the overall sentiment would be negative. Alternatively, maybe the user is trying to correct a misconception, leading to a positive sentiment. But I think the key here is that the recommendation is negative.

The first part is positive: \"Güzel bir ürün\" means \"a nice product,\" which is clearly a positive statement. However, the second part starts with \"ancak,\" which translates to \"but,\" indicating a contrast.

But according to the rules, I need to determine the overall sentiment. Since the user is pointing out both a positive and a negative aspect, but the negative part is a significant drawback (durability), it might tip the balance towards negative. However, sometimes in such cases, if the positive and negative are balanced, it could be neutral. But here, the positive is about the product being nice, which is a general compliment, while the negative is about durability, which is a functional aspect. Depending on context, but since the user is highlighting both, maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because they're presenting both sides without a clear emphasis on one over the other. Wait, but in some cases, even if there's a contrast, the presence of both positive and negative can lead to neutral. However, sometimes the negative part might be more impactful. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the example given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" translates to \"Okay for the price,\" which is neutral. Similarly, here, the user is saying it's a nice product but not very durable. So they're giving both positive and negative feedback. The overall sentiment might be neutral because it's a balanced view without strong positive or negative dominance. But I need to check if the system considers mixed sentiments as neutral. According to standard sentiment analysis, if there are both positive and negative elements, it can be classified as neutral unless one outweighs the other.

Even though the first part is neutral (just stating arrival), the overall sentiment is positive because of the hopeful and optimistic ending. There's no negative language here, just anticipation and a desire for a good result. So the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Translating it, it means \"a good product for its price.\" The key words here are \"iyi\" (good) and \"fiyatına göre\" (for its price). The user is saying that despite the price, the product is good. \n\nNow, looking at the sentiment labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The sentence doesn't have any negative words. It's expressing a positive opinion about the product relative to its cost. So it should be POSITIVE.\n\nWait, but sometimes people might think that if it's \"for its price,\" maybe it's neutral because they're just saying it's good in comparison. But in Turkish, when someone says \"fiyatına göre iyi,\" they are generally satisfied with the product's value, which is a positive sentiment. The user isn't complaining; they're acknowledging the product's quality relative to the cost. So I think POSITIVE is correct here.\n\nI should make sure there's no sarcasm or hidden meaning, but the sentence is straightforward. No negative words, so definitely not NEGATIVE. NEUTRAL would be if it was a factual statement without opinion, like \"the product works.\" But here, \"iyi\" is a clear positive adjective.

Daha pahalı ürünlere hiç gerek yok.\" I need to analyze this and determine the sentiment.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentences. The first part is \"Çok memnun kaldım,\" which translates to \"I am very satisfied.\" That's clearly a positive statement. The second part is \"Daha pahalı ürünlere hiç gerek yok,\" meaning \"There's no need for more expensive products.\" This could be interpreted as the user finding the product good enough, not needing anything pricier. \n\nNow, considering the sentiment labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The first sentence is undeniably positive. The second part might seem neutral at first glance because it's stating a fact about not needing more expensive items. However, in context, saying that there's no need for pricier products could imply that the current product is satisfactory, which reinforces the positive sentiment. \n\nBut wait, sometimes people might say they don't need more expensive products because they're satisfied with the current one, which is a positive take. Alternatively, if someone says they don't need more expensive products because they can't afford them, that's different. But here, the user is expressing satisfaction, so it's more about being content rather than financial constraints.\n\nSo combining both parts, the overall sentiment is positive. The user is happy with the product and doesn't see a need for more expensive alternatives. Therefore, the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The user ends with \"teşekkür ederim TRENDYOL ❤️,\" expressing gratitude and a heart emoji, which reinforces the positive sentiment.\n\nThere's no negative language here. All aspects—color, quality, packaging, delivery speed—are praised. Even though there's a mention of \"titreşimi\" (vibration), it's in a context that's positive, indicating strong performance.

Then there's \"sürüşü çok basit\" meaning \"the driving is very simple,\" which is also positive. The last part is \"dağılma yapmıyor\" which means \"doesn't spread\" or \"doesn't disperse.\" Depending on context, this could be neutral or even negative if it's about something not spreading as expected.

However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the overall sentiment, the first two parts are strongly positive.

Translating that to English, it's something like \"Honestly, it doesn't have as big an effect as it's being praised.\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment here. The key words are \"gereksiz\" which means unnecessary or useless, and \"övüldüğü kadar büyük bir etkisi yok\" which translates to \"doesn't have as much effect as it's being praised.\" The speaker is pointing out that something is being overestimated, implying dissatisfaction.\n\nThe use of \"açıkcası\" (honestly) adds a directness to the statement. The overall tone seems negative because the person is criticizing the exaggeration of the effect. Even though there's no explicit negative word like \"horrible\" or \"bad,\" the implication is that the thing being discussed isn't as effective as people think, which leans towards a negative sentiment.\n\nI should check if there's any neutral aspect, but the criticism here is clear.

Could it be a misspelling of \"beğendim,\" meaning \"I liked\"? If that's the case, then the sentence would make more sense: \"I liked it at a good price.\" That would definitely be positive. \n\nBut if \"beşendim\" is correct, maybe the user meant \"beşendim\" as in \"I was surprised,\" which could be neutral or positive depending on context. However, combined with \"güzel fiyata iyi,\" which is clearly positive, it's more likely that there was a typo and they meant \"beğendim.\" \n\nAssuming the correct word is \"beğendim,\" the sentiment is positive.

The first part mentions the price being high, which is a negative point. However, the second part talks about the product arriving in good condition, which is positive. \n\nNow, the challenge is determining whether the overall sentiment is more negative, positive, or neutral. The user is pointing out both a downside (high price) and an upside (product arrived safely). But since they're using \"ama\" (but), it seems like they're emphasizing that despite the high price, the product was good. \n\nIn such cases, sometimes the sentiment can be neutral because there's a balance of positive and negative aspects. However, sometimes the emphasis on one part over the other might tip the scale. Here, the user might be expressing satisfaction with the product despite the price, which could lean towards positive.

However, in some contexts, mentioning that the product was good despite the high price could be seen as a positive experience, especially if the user is highlighting the quality of the product over the cost. \n\nBut I should also consider common sentiment analysis practices.

First, I need to understand what this means in Turkish. \"Beden ölçüsü\" translates to \"body size\" or \"body measurement,\" and \"dar\" means \"narrow.\" So the sentence is saying \"The body size is narrow.\"\n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The word \"dar\" can have different connotations depending on context. If someone is talking about clothing, like a shirt being too tight, that might be negative. But if it's about a body type, maybe it's neutral? Wait, but in Turkish, when describing body measurements, saying it's narrow could be seen as a negative trait, implying the person is thin or not well-proportioned. However, sometimes it might just be a factual statement without emotional charge.\n\nBut looking at the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled NEUTRAL. That translates to \"Okay for the price,\" which is a neutral comment. So maybe if the text is stating a fact without positive or negative emotions, it's neutral. However, \"dar\" might carry a slight negative connotation here. But I need to check if there's any explicit positive or negative words.\n\nThe original examples had clear positive and negative words like \"harikaydı\" (amazing) and \"zehirlendim\" (poisoned). In this case, \"dar\" isn't inherently positive or negative. It's more of a descriptive term. Unless there's an implied judgment. But without additional context, it's safer to label it as NEUTRAL because it's just stating a measurement fact without expressing a clear sentiment.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Then there's a contrast with \"Günlük kullanıma uygun\" meaning suitable for daily use, which is neutral. But then it says \"fakat abartılacak kadar da iyi değil,\" which translates to \"but not good enough to be exaggerated.\" This part seems negative because it's downplaying the product's quality.\n\nSo there's a mix of positive and negative elements. The user is pointing out both good aspects (pleasant scent, suitable for daily use) and a criticism (not good enough). However, the overall sentiment might lean towards neutral because the positive and negative points balance each other out. The user isn't overly enthusiastic but also not completely dissatisfied.

So they're talking about purple fabrics. The phrase \"en iyisi\" means \"the best,\" which is a positive term. But wait, is there any context that might make this negative? Like maybe sarcasm or hidden meaning?\n\nBut the sentence seems straightforward. It's stating that among purple sampuans, this one is the best. There's no obvious negative words here.

However, sometimes in Turkish, people might use \"en iyisi\" in a way that's neutral, but I think in most cases, it's positive. \n\nWait, could there be any ambiguity?

The text is: \"Yorumlara bakarak aldım cildi iyi temizliyor ancak göz makyajında başarılı değil malesef\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The person says they bought something based on reviews, and it cleans the skin well. However, they mention that it's not successful in eye makeup, unfortunately.\n\nBreaking it down: The positive part is about the product cleaning the skin effectively. But then there's a negative aspect regarding eye makeup performance. The word \"malesef\" (unfortunately) emphasizes the disappointment here.\n\nNow, considering the rules. The task requires determining if the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Since there are both positive and negative elements, but the negative part seems to be a significant drawback, especially in a specific area (eye makeup). However, the user might have mixed feelings. But according to standard sentiment analysis, if there's a clear negative aspect that outweighs the positive, it would lean towards negative. Alternatively, if both are balanced, maybe neutral. \n\nBut looking at examples given: For instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. Here, the user has both positive and negative points but ends on a negative note with \"malesef\". The overall sentiment might be more negative because the criticism is specific and the disappointment is expressed. However, some might argue it's mixed. But according to the rules, if there's a clear negative part that's emphasized, it should be labeled as NEGATIVE. Alternatively, maybe NEUTRAL if both sides are present. Wait, but in the example where there was a positive and a negative, like \"Yemek harikaydı.\" is positive, but if there's a mix, perhaps neutral? But the user's example with \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. \n\nIn this case, the user mentions both good (cleans skin) and bad (not good for eye makeup). However, the negative part is highlighted with \"malesef\", which might make the overall sentiment more negative. Alternatively, if it's a balanced review, maybe neutral. But I think in many cases, mixed sentiments where there's a clear negative point would be considered negative. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both positive and negative aspects makes it neutral. But I need to check the rules again. The user says that if the text has both positive and negative elements but no clear dominance, then neutral. However, in this case, the negative part is a specific failure, which might be more impactful. \n\nBut according to standard sentiment analysis practices, mixed sentiments can sometimes be neutral. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The user says they bought based on reviews, and it works for skin cleaning but fails in eye makeup. The overall experience might be negative because the product didn't meet expectations in a key area. So maybe NEGATIVE. \n\nAlternatively, if the positive and negative are balanced, then NEUTRAL. But I think the presence of \"malesef\" indicates that the negative part is more significant. Therefore, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The text is: \"Ben saç bakım yağindan memnun kaldım ama tırnak yağı yerine vazelin yetermiş.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The person is talking about two products: a hair care oil and a nail oil. They mention being satisfied with the hair care oil (\"memnun kaldım\"), which is positive. However, they then say that instead of the nail oil, vaseline was sufficient (\"vazelin yetermiş\"). That part seems negative because it's implying that the nail oil wasn't necessary or effective.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The sentence has both positive and negative elements. But in Turkish, when there's a contrast like \"ama\" (but), the latter part often carries more weight. However, the user might be expressing satisfaction with one product but dissatisfaction with another. Since the instruction is to classify the entire text into POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL, I need to see if the overall sentiment leans more towards positive or negative.\n\nBut wait, the example given in the instructions had a similar structure where \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. Here, the user is satisfied with one product but not the other. However, since both products are mentioned and there's a mix of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, maybe it's neutral? But I need to check if the overall sentiment is more negative or positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main point is that they were satisfied with the hair oil but found the nail oil unnecessary. Since the user is expressing satisfaction with one product and criticism of another, perhaps the overall sentiment is mixed. However, according to the rules, we have to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nIn such cases where there's a mix, if both positive and negative elements are present but not clearly dominant, it might be considered NEUTRAL. But I need to check if the examples provided by the user can help. For example, in the third example, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral because it's a balanced statement.\n\nIn this case, since there's both satisfaction and dissatisfaction, but no clear dominance, maybe NEUTRAL is appropriate. However, sometimes the presence of positive and negative parts might lead to a more complex analysis. But according to the rules, we have to pick one label. Let me think again: the user was satisfied with one product (positive) but found another product unnecessary (negative). Since both are present, it's a mix. If the instruction says that in such cases, how should I decide?\n\nLooking back at the examples, when there's a contrast like \"ama\", sometimes the overall sentiment can be negative if the latter part is more critical. But here, the user was satisfied with one product and not the other. However, since both products are different, maybe it's neutral because the satisfaction in one area is offset by dissatisfaction in another.\n\nAlternatively, if the main point is that they were happy with the hair oil but not the nail oil, perhaps the overall sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative. Therefore, NEUTRAL might be the correct label here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The use of \"kesinlikle\" (definitely) and the emoji reinforces the positive sentiment.\n\nLooking for any negative words or phrases, but I don't see any here.

The first sentence is \"Güzel bir serum ile denemenizde fayda var.\" Translating that, it means \"It's beneficial to try a good serum.\" The word \"güzel\" translates to \"good\" or \"beautiful,\" which is positive. The phrase \"fayda var\" means \"there is benefit,\" so this part is definitely positive.\n\nThe second part is \"Hızlı kargo teşekkürler.\" Which is \"Fast shipping, thank you.\" Here, the user is thanking for the fast delivery. Expressing gratitude is a positive sentiment as well. \n\nLooking at the overall message, both parts are expressing satisfaction and appreciation. There's no negative language or complaints. The user is happy with the product (serum) and the service (shipping). So combining these two positive elements, the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The packaging was also nice.\"\n\nFirst, looking at the positive aspects. The user mentions that the product arrived quickly (\"iki günde ulaştı\"), which is a positive point about delivery time. They also note that the product was original (\"Orjinal ürün geldi\"), which is good because it confirms authenticity. Additionally, they comment on the packaging being nice (\"Paketlenmesi de güzeldi\"), another positive remark.\n\nHowever, there's a neutral part: \"Henüz kullanmadım\" (I haven't used it yet). This indicates that the user hasn't had the chance to test the product's quality or functionality. Since they haven't used it, they can't provide feedback on its performance, which makes that part neutral.\n\nNow, considering all parts together. The delivery time, authenticity, and packaging are positive points. The lack of usage is neutral. There's no negative language here. Even though the user hasn't used the product, they didn't express any dissatisfaction.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The first part is \"Yapısı olarak çok güzel\" which translates to \"The structure is very good.\" That's clearly a positive statement. Then there's \"fakat\" which means \"but,\" indicating a contrast. The second part is \"ton renginde karar verirken dikkat edilmeli\" – \"care should be taken when deciding on the tone color.\" \n\nSo, the user is saying that while the structure is good, there's a caution about the tone color. The positive aspect is acknowledged, but there's a negative point about needing to be careful. However, the overall sentiment isn't entirely negative because it starts with a positive remark and then gives a warning rather than outright criticism. \n\nBut wait, in sentiment analysis, even if there's a mix, sometimes the presence of both positive and negative elements can lead to neutral. But here, the main point might be that despite the good structure, there's an issue with the tone color. However, the user is advising caution rather than expressing dissatisfaction. So maybe it's more on the neutral side because they're pointing out a necessary consideration without strong negative language. Alternatively, since there's a positive and a negative part, but the negative part isn't strongly worded, perhaps it's still positive? Hmm.\n\nWait, the example given in the instructions: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. So when there's a mix of positive and negative elements, but not strong enough to be clearly one or the other, it's neutral. In this case, the user starts with a positive comment about the structure, then mentions a need for caution regarding tone color. The overall sentiment isn't strongly negative or positive; it's more of a balanced view with both aspects. Therefore, the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Let me check again.\n\nThe first part: \"Makina gücü yetersiz işe yarayacağını düşünmüyorum\" – the user is saying they don't think the machine's power is inadequate for the task. That sounds positive because they're confident in the machine's capability. Then there's \"İade 👍\". \"İade\" means refund, and the thumbs-up emoji suggests a positive sentiment towards the refund process.

It translates to \"I didn't like it\" or \"I didn't approve of it.\" The root word is \"beğenmek,\" which means \"to like\" or \"to approve.\" Adding the suffix \"-medim\" negates the verb, so the whole word becomes \"did not like.\"\n\nNow, considering the sentiment. Since the user is expressing a negative feeling towards something, the label should be NEGATIVE. There's no ambiguity here because the word directly conveys dissatisfaction. The rules mention that if the text is clearly positive, negative, or neutral, we assign the corresponding label.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, translating the sentence might help. \"Kumasi\" is a Turkish word for \"the fabric\" or \"material.\" \"Sert\" means hard or stiff. \"Göründüğü gibi değil\" translates to \"isn't as it seems\" or \"not as it appears.\" So the whole sentence is saying that the material isn't as hard as it looks.\n\nNow, considering the context. If someone is talking about fabric, mentioning that it's not as stiff as it appears could be a positive thing if they're implying it's softer than expected. But without more context, like whether the user is satisfied with this or not, it's tricky. The sentence itself is stating a fact, but the sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative. It might be neutral because it's just an observation without expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction.\n\nWait, but maybe in some contexts, pointing out that something isn't as hard as it seems could be positive if the user prefers softer materials. However, since there's no explicit emotion or evaluation, like \"I'm happy\" or \"I'm disappointed,\" it's safer to label it as neutral.

The challenge here is determining whether the overall sentiment leans more towards positive, negative, or if it's neutral. The user acknowledges a benefit but also points out a significant drawback. However, in many cases, such reviews might be considered negative because the negative aspect (the product turning to powder) seems to be a deal-breaker for them. But I need to check if the overall sentiment is more negative than positive or vice versa.\n\nIn some contexts, if there's an equal balance, it might be neutral. However, in this case, the user starts with a positive note but ends with a strong negative point that they couldn't like the product because of that feature. The use of \"maalesef\" (unfortunately) emphasizes their disappointment.

The words \"çok güzel\" are positive adjectives. In Turkish, \"güzel\" is a strong positive term. The verb \"kokuyor\" here is neutral in itself, but combined with \"güzel,\" it conveys a positive impression. There's no negative language here.

This seems like a mixed review, but according to the rules, if there's a mix, I should look for the dominant sentiment or check if it's neutral.\n\nBut wait, the instructions say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there are both positive and negative points, but the user is giving a balanced view without strongly leaning one way, maybe it's NEUTRAL. However, sometimes in such cases, if the positive and negative aspects are equally weighted, it might be neutral. Alternatively, if the negative aspect is more impactful, it could be negative. But the user ends on a note that suggests it's still usable, which might tip it towards neutral because they're not strongly negative but pointing out a con.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial positive comment is strong enough to make it positive, but the negative part is a significant drawback. However, since the user is giving both sides without a clear preference, NEUTRAL might be the right choice here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this analysis. The user provided a Turkish text that needs to be categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. First, I'll read through the text carefully.\n\nThe text starts with \"Yapısı çok güzel,\" which translates to \"Its structure is very good.\" That's a positive statement. Then it says, \"Aşina olunan ağır ya da beyazlık bırakan güneş kremlerinden değil,\" meaning \"It's not one of the heavy or whitening sunscreens that are familiar.\" This part seems neutral because it's comparing to other products but not explicitly negative.\n\nNext, the user mentions, \"Fakat güneşten koruma konusunda çok başarılı bulmadım.\" Translating to \"But I didn't find it very successful in terms of sun protection.\" Here, the word \"fakat\" (but) introduces a contrast. The person is expressing dissatisfaction with the sun protection aspect, which is a negative point.\n\nNow, I need to weigh these parts. The first part is positive, but the latter part is negative. However, the overall sentiment might lean towards neutral because the user is pointing out both a positive and a negative aspect without strongly favoring one over the other. But wait, in some cases, if there's a clear contrast where the negative part is more impactful, it could be negative. However, since the user didn't use strong negative words beyond \"bulmadım\" (didn't find), which is moderate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positive and negative aspects balance each other out, leading to neutral. But I should check if the structure of the sentence emphasizes the negative part more. The use of \"fakat\" might indicate that the negative point is a criticism, but since it's not overly harsh, perhaps it's still neutral.\n\nWait, looking at the example given in the instructions: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as neutral. That's similar to this case where there's a mix of positive and negative but no strong sentiment. However, in the user's text, the first part is positive, then a contrast with a negative point. But since the overall evaluation isn't strongly negative or positive, maybe it's neutral.\n\nBut another angle: if the user mentions both pros and cons, but doesn't have a clear overall sentiment, it might be neutral. However, sometimes in such cases, the presence of both could lead to mixed feelings, but according to the rules, we need to pick one label. The key is whether the negative part outweighs the positive or not.\n\nIn this case, the user says the structure is good (positive) but didn't find it successful in sun protection (negative). Since these are different aspects, and there's no clear dominance of one over the other, the overall sentiment might be neutral. However, some might argue that the negative part is a criticism of a key function (sun protection), making it more negative. But since the user didn't use strong negative language, maybe it's still neutral.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the user is pointing out a failure in a critical aspect (sunscreen effectiveness), even if they mention a positive point, the overall sentiment could be negative. However, without stronger words like \"kötü\" or \"başarısız,\" it's more of a moderate criticism.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. The example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is a balanced statement. In this case, the user has both positive and negative points but doesn't strongly lean either way. Therefore, labeling it as neutral might be appropriate.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user starts with \"gayet memnunum,\" which means they're very satisfied. That's a strong positive indicator. Then they mention a minor issue: stiffness in the hair. However, they immediately follow that by saying it's common in purple shampoos, implying that this is a known issue and not unique to this product. \n\nSo even though there's a negative point mentioned (stiffness), the user downplays it by attributing it to a general characteristic of the product type. The overall sentiment is still positive because the main experience is satisfaction, and the negative aspect is presented as a common occurrence rather than a flaw specific to this product.\n\nI should check if there's any hidden negativity here.

They point out some issues (noise, yellow parts darkening) which are negative aspects. However, they also mention they didn't return it due to the discount and call it \"normalin altında\" which translates to below average. But since they didn't return it, maybe there's a slight positive aspect in terms of value for money? Wait, but \"below average\" is still a negative comment about the product quality.\n\nBut the overall sentiment seems neutral because they're not strongly positive or negative.

The phrase \"karma ciltler için efsane\" translates to \"a legend for combination skin.\" \"Efsane\" means legend or legendary, which is a very positive adjective. \n\nPutting it all together, the user is expressing that their favorite product, which they've used for years, is considered legendary for combination skin. There's no negative language here. The words used are all positive: \"sevdiğim,\" \"efsane,\" and the context of long-term use suggests continued satisfaction.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The first part is \"çok hızlı kuruyor\" which translates to \"dries very quickly.\" Depending on context, drying quickly can be a good or bad thing. If it's about something like paint or a product that needs to dry fast, maybe positive. But if it's about something that shouldn't dry too fast, like a cosmetic, it might be negative.\n\nThe second part is \"ojeleri matlastirmak için kullanılabilir\" which means \"can be used to matte lips.\" So the user is talking about a product that dries quickly and can be used for matting lips. Now, considering lip products, if they dry too fast, that's usually a negative because it might cause discomfort or not last long. However, the ability to use it for matting could be seen as a positive feature.\n\nBut looking at the overall sentiment here. The user mentions both aspects: drying quickly (which is likely a negative) and being usable for a specific purpose (positive). But in product reviews, if something dries too fast, that's often a drawback. However, the second part might be a positive point. But since the first part is a complaint about speed of drying, which is a common issue, the overall sentiment might lean negative.\n\nWait, but maybe the user is neutral? They're stating two facts: it dries quickly and can be used for matting. If they didn't express any strong opinion, just stating features, then it's neutral. But in Turkish reviews, sometimes even if there are negatives, the presence of a positive might balance it. However, the first part is \"çok hızlı kuruyor\" which could be negative. The second part is a positive use case. So maybe the user is pointing out both pros and cons, making it neutral.\n\nBut I need to check examples given. For instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. So if there's a mix of positive and negative aspects without clear sentiment, it's neutral. Here, the user mentions a drawback (dries too fast) but also a use case (can be used for matting). However, the overall tone might not be clearly positive or negative. But maybe the fact that they mention using it for matting is a positive, but the drying quickly is a negative. Since both are mentioned without clear emphasis on one over the other, perhaps neutral.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is saying that despite drying quickly, it can be used for something else, which might be a positive. But I think in this case, since there's no explicit positive or negative sentiment words beyond stating facts, it's more likely to be neutral.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

However, the overall sentiment isn't strongly negative. It's more of a neutral observation with a minor critique.\n\nConsidering the options: POSITIVE would require clear positive language, NEGATIVE if there's strong criticism, and NEUTRAL if it's balanced or mixed.

The first part is positive: \"Rengi güzel\" which means the color is good. That's a positive statement. However, the second part has two negative points: \"çok bulasıyor\" (very sticky) and \"bütünleşmiyor\" (doesn't blend in).

But here, the user isn't just saying it's okay; they're pointing out specific negatives that could affect the product's usability or quality.

The user starts with \"çok güzel\" which translates to \"very good\" or \"very nice.\" That's a strong positive adjective. Then they mention \"bir kokusu var\" meaning \"has a scent\" or \"has a fragrance,\" which is neutral on its own but combined with the previous part, it's positive. \n\nNext part: \"cildimi yumuşacık yaptı.\" Translating to \"made my skin soft.\" The word \"yumuşacık\" means soft, and in this context, it's a positive effect.

The key words are \"çok yağlı\" which means \"very fatty,\" and \"hiç kapatıcı özelliği yok\" meaning \"no closing property at all.\" Both phrases seem negative. \"Çok yağlı\" might be a negative descriptor depending on context, but in food reviews, sometimes people mention high fat content as a negative aspect if it's not desired. However, \"fondöten\" is fondue, which is typically a dish that's supposed to be melted cheese, so maybe the user is talking about a type of fondue that's too oily. \n\nThen, \"hiç kapatıcı özelliği yok\" is definitely negative. If something is supposed to have a closing property (maybe referring to a lid or a seal), and it doesn't, that's a problem. So both parts of the sentence are pointing out flaws or negatives.\n\nI should check if there's any positive aspect, but I don't see any. The user is complaining about two things: the fondue being too fatty and lacking a closing feature.

Translating that to English, it means something like \"As long as you use it, there's a benefit. But when you stop, you go back to where you were.\" \n\nHmm, the first part is positive because it mentions a benefit while using the product or service. However, the second part talks about reverting to the previous state once discontinued, which sounds negative. The user is pointing out that the product has temporary benefits but doesn't provide lasting results.\n\nSo there's a mix of positive and negative sentiments here.

Since the overall message seems to highlight the downside more—implying that the benefit is only temporary—the dominant sentiment might be negative. However, some might argue it's neutral because it's stating facts without strong emotional language. Wait, but the example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is more of a balanced statement. Here, though, there's a contrast between positive and negative aspects. But maybe the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the temporary nature of the benefit, making it negative. Alternatively, if the sentiment is mixed but not strongly leaning either way, neutral could be appropriate. However, in the examples provided, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was considered neutral because it's a balanced opinion. In this case, the user is pointing out both pros and cons, so maybe it's neutral. But I need to check if there's a stronger negative sentiment. The second part says \"bırakınca başa dönüyorsunuz\" which implies that stopping leads to going back to the original problem, which might be more negative. However, the first part is positive. It's tricky. Maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because it's presenting both sides without a clear preference. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the user is highlighting the downside of discontinuation, maybe it's leaning towards negative. Wait, but in the examples, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral even though it's a positive statement. So perhaps here, since there are both positive and negative aspects mentioned, it's considered neutral. But I need to make sure. The key is whether the sentiment is predominantly positive or negative. If the user is expressing that the product has benefits but also drawbacks, maybe it's neutral. However, if the main point is the negative consequence of stopping, then it might be negative. But the first part is positive. It's a bit ambiguous.

So the label should be NEGATIVE.\n\nI need to make sure there's no neutral nuance. Sometimes people use phrases that are neutral, but in this case, the verb is in the negative form. The user might be hesitant or not strongly negative, but the overall sentiment is still negative. So the correct label is NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user wrote, \"güzel koku surekli kullaniyorum,\" which translates to \"I keep using the nice scent.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The key words are \"güzel\" (nice) and \"surekli kullaniyorum\" (keep using). \"Güzel\" is clearly positive, indicating satisfaction with the product's scent. The fact that they mention using it continuously suggests a positive experience.\n\nI should check if there's any negative connotation. Words like \"surekli\" (continuously) might sometimes imply overuse, but in this context, it's more about consistent usage rather than a complaint. There's no negative language here.\n\nNeutral could be considered if the sentiment wasn't clear, but since \"güzel\" is explicitly positive and the action of using it repeatedly is a positive indicator, the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Başarılı\" means successful or successful, which is a positive word. Then \"ürün paketleme\" refers to product packaging. The phrase \"güzeldi\" translates to \"was beautiful\" or \"was good.\" Both \"başarılı\" and \"güzeldi\" are positive adjectives. \n\nSo the sentence is saying that the product packaging was successful and beautiful. There's no negative language here. Even though \"paketleme\" (packaging) could sometimes be a neutral term, in this context, it's being described positively. \n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but Turkish doesn't use sarcasm as much as English, and the words used are straightforward. No negative words are present. Therefore, the sentiment is positive.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The text is: \"Ürün jarse kumaş ve beden büyük salaş normal bir zamanda olsa geri gönderirdim fakat virüsten dolayı çıkamayacam.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user mentions that the product is made of \"jarse kumaş\" (which I think is a type of fabric, maybe stretchy or something), and the size is too big (\"beden büyük\"). They say they would return it under normal circumstances (\"normal bir zamanda olsa geri gönderirdim\"), but due to the virus (\"virüsten dolayı çıkamayacam\"), they can't.\n\nNow, breaking down the sentiment. The user is talking about a product they received that doesn't fit well (size too big) and the fabric might not be satisfactory (\"jarse kumaş\" could be negative if it's not what they expected). However, they mention they would return it normally but can't because of the virus. \n\nThe key points here are the dissatisfaction with the product (size and material), which leans towards negative. But there's also a reason why they can't return it, which might add some context. However, the main sentiment is about the product not meeting their expectations. The mention of the virus is more of an external factor preventing them from returning it, but it doesn't change the fact that they're unhappy with the product.\n\nSo, considering the overall sentiment, even though there's a mitigating circumstance (virus), the primary feeling is negative towards the product. Therefore, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Translating that to English, it's something like \"The product has some flaws, but it's not bad and can be used.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The key words are \"biraz dağılma\" which means \"some flaws\" or \"a bit of a problem,\" then \"fena değil\" which translates to \"not bad\" or \"okay,\" and finally \"kullanılabilir\" meaning \"usable\" or \"can be used.\"\n\nThe user is pointing out that the product has some issues, but overall, it's still acceptable. The presence of both negative (\"biraz dağılma\") and positive (\"fena değil\", \"kullanılabilir\") elements makes this a bit tricky. However, in sentiment analysis, when there's a mix but the overall tone is more towards acceptance or neutrality, it might lean to neutral.\n\nBut wait, \"fena değil\" is a positive statement, indicating that despite the flaws, the product is still okay. The user isn't overly negative; they're acknowledging the problem but also stating that it's usable. So maybe it's more positive than negative? However, the presence of the flaw might make some lean towards neutral.\n\nBut looking at the example given in the instructions: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is \"Okay for the price,\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. Similarly, here, even though there's a positive note, the mention of flaws could be seen as a negative aspect. However, since the overall sentiment isn't strongly negative or positive, it might still be neutral.\n\nAlternatively, if the user had said \"Ürün fena değil\" without mentioning any flaws, that would be more positive. But here, they're balancing both aspects. So I think NEUTRAL is the correct label here because it's a mixed sentiment but not strongly leaning either way.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The context is about a product's scent being successful and amazing.\n\nNow, checking for any negative connotations. There are none here. The words used are all positive.

The user mentions they can tell it's organic from the smell, which might be a positive point.\n\nBut then there's a negative aspect: the bottle isn't made of glass. They use \"keşke\" which means \"if only,\" expressing a wish that the bottle was glass. This implies dissatisfaction with the current material, probably plastic. \n\nSo there's both a positive and a negative element here. However, in sentiment analysis, we need to determine the overall sentiment. The user is pointing out a positive quality (organic) but also a negative aspect (non-glass container). But since they're making a wish for the bottle to be glass, it's more of a complaint about the packaging rather than the product itself. \n\nBut wait, the main point here might be that even though the product is good (organic), the packaging isn't ideal. However, the sentiment analysis needs to consider the overall tone. The user is not entirely negative; they acknowledge the organic aspect positively but express a wish for improvement in the packaging. \n\nIn such cases, if there's a mix of positive and negative sentiments, but the negative part is a suggestion or a minor complaint, sometimes it might lean towards neutral. However, since the user is expressing dissatisfaction with a specific aspect (the bottle material), that could be seen as a negative sentiment. But the presence of a positive element complicates things.\n\nWait, the instructions say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The example given for \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. So if there's both positive and negative elements but no clear dominance, it might be neutral. However, in this case, the user is pointing out a positive (organic) but also a negative (non-glass bottle). But the main sentiment here is more about the packaging issue, which is a negative point. However, since they are not entirely negative about the product itself, maybe it's neutral?\n\nAlternatively, if the overall sentiment is mixed but the user is expressing a wish for improvement, perhaps it's neutral. Because the positive and negative aspects balance each other out. But I need to check the rules again. The examples given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral because it's a balanced statement.

That's definitely negative points.\n\nBut then they say they haven't used the product yet but after using it, their skin became soft and spots faded, and they liked the product.

Then they say they can't comment on spots (\"lekeler için bişey diyemiyorum\") because they've only been using it for three days (\"daha 3 gündür kullanıyorum\").\n\nNow, analyzing the sentiment. The positive aspect is the moisturizing effect. However, there's a negative point about the size being small.

The use of \"fakat\" (but) indicates that despite the small size, the moisturizing is good. So the overall sentiment might be neutral because there's both a negative and a positive point. However, sometimes in such cases, if one aspect is more emphasized, it could tip the scale.\n\nBut considering the user also mentions they can't comment on spots yet, which adds another layer of neutrality.

It seems like they're talking about a chair (koltuk) and some product (slt maybe?), mentioning that there's no whitening effect (beyazlaşma etkisi yok), but it's good at keeping things in place (güzel koruyor) and doesn't cause sweating (ter yapmıyor).\n\nNow, looking for positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

However, the presence of \"güzel koruyor\" and \"ter yapmıyor\" are positive aspects. The absence of whitening might be a negative point, but the user is highlighting the positives. It's a bit tricky. \n\nHowever, since there's both positive and negative elements, but the overall sentiment isn't clearly negative or positive.

But I need to check if the positive aspects outweigh the negative or vice versa. The user says \"sadece güzel koruyor\" which is positive, and \"ter yapmıyor\" another positive. The absence of whitening effect is a negative, but maybe it's not a major issue for the user. \n\nAlternatively, since they mention that there's no whitening effect (which might be a feature they wanted), but then say other positives, it could be neutral because they're pointing out both pros and cons without strong sentiment.

The user starts with \"çok seviyorum\" which translates to \"I love it very much.\" That's a strong positive statement.

The next part is \"kaliciligida harika\" meaning \"the longevity is also wonderful.\" Finally, \"misler gibi kokuyorsunuz\" – \"misler\" might be a typo for \"mısra\" (verse) but in context, it's more likely referring to something like \"you smell like verses\" or maybe a brand name. However, the key positive words here are \"seviyorum,\" \"harika,\" and \"kaliciligida harika.\"\n\nThere's no negative language here.

The user wrote, \"Kargom gecikmiş olsa bile iyi alışveriş uygun fiyat teşekkürler.\" Translating that to English: \"Even though my package was delayed, good shopping, reasonable price, thank you.\"\n\nFirst, the main points here are the complaint about the delivery delay and then positive aspects like good shopping experience, reasonable prices, and gratitude. The user is expressing both a negative point (delayed package) and positive ones (good shopping, affordable prices, thanks). \n\nNow, according to the rules, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The challenge here is that there's a mix of negative and positive elements. However, in such cases where there's a complaint but also appreciation, it might lean towards neutral because the user is acknowledging both sides. But sometimes, if the positive aspects outweigh the negative, it could be positive. \n\nBut looking at the structure: the user starts with a negative point (\"kargom gecikmiş olsa bile\" – \"even though my package was delayed\"), then lists positives. The use of \"bile\" (even though) suggests that despite the delay, they still had a good experience. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a clear complaint followed by appreciation, it might be considered neutral because the user is pointing out an issue but also expressing satisfaction with other aspects. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the positive elements are more significant here. But I think the key is that the user is mentioning both negative and positive points without clearly leaning one way. Therefore, the most accurate label would be \"NEUTRAL\" because it's a mix of sentiments without a clear dominant one.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user wrote, \"Kokusu çok güzel ama pek bir fayda göremwdim.\" First, I need to understand the sentiment here. The first part is positive: \"Kokusu çok güzel\" translates to \"The smell is very nice,\" which is clearly a positive statement. However, the second part says \"ama pek bir fayda göremwdim.\" The word \"ama\" means \"but,\" indicating a contrast. The user mentions not seeing much benefit (\"pek bir fayda göremwdim\"), which seems negative. But wait, there's a typo here: \"göremwdim\" should be \"göremedim.\" Even with the typo, the intended meaning is that the user didn't notice much benefit.\n\nSo, the sentence has both positive and negative elements. The challenge is determining which part dominates. In sentiment analysis, when there's a contrast like this, it often depends on the context and the weight of each part. However, since the user is pointing out a lack of benefit despite the pleasant smell, the overall sentiment might lean towards neutral because they're expressing both positive and negative aspects without strong emphasis on either. Alternatively, if the negative part is more significant, it could be negative. But considering that the user acknowledges the good smell but points out a drawback, it's possible they're neutral. However, sometimes in such cases, the presence of a negative aspect can make the overall sentiment negative. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the example given. In the examples, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. That's a balanced statement. Similarly, here, the user has both positive and negative points. The key is whether the negative part outweighs the positive. But since they didn't use strong negative words, just stating that there's no benefit, it might be more neutral. Alternatively, if the absence of benefit is considered a negative, then maybe NEGATIVE. However, in some contexts, mentioning both pros and cons without clear emphasis could be neutral. I think in this case, the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the lack of benefit despite the good smell, so the overall sentiment might be negative. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again.\n\nThe first part is positive, but the second part introduces a negative aspect. However, the use of \"ama\" (but) suggests that the negative part is a criticism. So maybe the overall sentiment is more negative because they're pointing out a drawback. Alternatively, if it's a balanced view, neutral. But in many cases, when someone says something is good but has a downside, it can be seen as mixed, which would be neutral. However, the examples given by the user might have different criteria. For instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral because it's a balanced statement about price. Similarly, here, the user is saying the smell is good but there's no benefit, so maybe that's considered neutral. But I'm not 100% certain. Another angle: if the negative part is more significant in terms of impact, then NEGATIVE. If both are equally weighted, NEUTRAL. Since the user didn't express strong dissatisfaction, just a lack of benefit, it might be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

In Turkish, when someone says something doesn't serve any purpose, it's a clear indication of dissatisfaction.

The user wrote, \"daha denemedim ama güzel.\" Translating that to English, it's \"I haven't tried it yet but it's nice.\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment here. The person hasn't used the product or service yet (\"daha denemedim\"), which might suggest a neutral stance because they can't provide a firsthand experience. However, they follow up with \"ama güzel,\" meaning \"but it's nice.\" The word \"güzel\" is clearly positive.\n\nBut wait, since they haven't tried it yet, does that negate the positivity? Maybe they're expressing a positive opinion based on hearsay or expectations. In some cases, people might say something is good even if they haven't experienced it themselves, perhaps based on recommendations.\n\nLooking at the rules again: the labels are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The challenge here is whether the overall sentiment leans positive despite not having tried it. However, the fact that they mention \"güzel\" directly indicates a positive feeling towards the subject, even if they haven't used it yet. \n\nAlternatively, could this be neutral because they haven't experienced it? But the presence of a clear positive adjective might tip it to POSITIVE. The conjunction \"ama\" (but) here is used to contrast the fact that they haven't tried it with their positive opinion. So maybe they're saying even though they haven't tried it, they think it's nice. That would still be a positive sentiment.\n\nI should check examples again. For instance, if someone says \"Fiyatına göre okey,\" which translates to \"It's okay for the price,\" that's neutral. But here, the user is explicitly stating something is \"güzel\" (nice), which is a strong positive term. Even though they haven't tried it, their opinion is still positive.\n\nTherefore, the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The text is: \"Henüz ürünü kullanmadım ama Bioderma nın ürünleri efsane ...Boyu küçük duruyor ama bayağı büyük bence\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The person hasn't used the product yet but mentions that Bioderma's products are legendary (\"efsane\"). Then there's a part about the size: \"Boyu küçük duruyor ama bayağı büyük bence\". Translating that, it's saying the size seems small but they think it's quite big.\n\nNow, breaking down the sentiment. The first part is positive because they're praising Bioderma's products as legendary. However, the second part has a contrast: \"small in size but I think it's quite big\". This might be a bit confusing. The user hasn't used the product yet, so their opinion is based on perception rather than actual experience.\n\nThe key here is that despite not using the product, they're still positive about the brand. The mention of the size could be neutral or slightly negative if they were disappointed, but since they say \"bayağı büyük bence\" (I think it's quite big), which is a positive statement. So even though the physical size might seem small, their perception is positive.\n\nPutting it all together: the overall sentiment is positive because they're complimenting the brand and expressing a favorable opinion about the product's size despite not having used it yet. There's no negative language here. The neutral part would be if there was no clear positive or negative sentiment, but in this case, the positive aspects outweigh any neutral observations.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The sentence starts with \"gerçekten çok güzel\" which translates to \"really very beautiful\" or \"truly very nice.\" That's a positive expression.\n\nNext, \"hızlı kargo\" means \"fast shipping,\" which is also a positive point. Then, \"saçlarımı yumuşacık yaptı\" translates to \"made my hair soft,\" which is another positive comment about the service or product effect.\n\nThe last part is \"ve full dolu,\" which literally means \"and full full.\" In Turkish slang, \"full dolu\" can mean something like \"completely filled\" or \"packed,\" but in this context, it might be referring to the product being full or satisfying. However, without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. But considering the previous positive statements, it's likely contributing to a positive sentiment.\n\nI need to check if there are any negative words.

The mention of a discount might also contribute to a more neutral stance because they're satisfied with the deal but not overly enthusiastic.\n\nI should check if there are any strong negative words.

So the user is likely expressing dissatisfaction with the product's longevity.\n\nI should check if there's any positive connotation here. Words like \"kalıcı\" (lasting) are positive, but since it's negated with \"değil\", it becomes negative. There's no other positive or neutral language in the sentence. The entire phrase is pointing out a drawback.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment is negative. The label should be \"NEGATIVE\".\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

I'm eagerly waiting for this big product to arrive. Did I say big? Yes, big.\"\n\nNow, looking at the keywords and tone. The user uses the word \"BÜYÜK\" (big) multiple times, which seems to be an emphasis on the size of the product. They mention placing an order just to see its size, which indicates curiosity or excitement. Phrases like \"merakla bekliyorum\" (eagerly waiting) suggest a positive anticipation. However, there's no explicit negative language here. The repetition of \"BÜYÜK\" might be sarcastic, but without more context, it's hard to tell. In Turkish, repeating words can sometimes indicate emphasis rather than sarcasm. \n\nConsidering the rules, I need to determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Since there's no clear negative language and the user is expressing eagerness and curiosity about the product's size, leaning towards POSITIVE makes sense. However, if the repetition of \"BÜYÜK\" was meant sarcastically (like implying it's not actually big), that could be negative. But without explicit negative words or context suggesting sarcasm, the safest bet is POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Maybe implying it's seasonal or not suitable for other times?\n- \"onun dışında renk kapatıcılık gayet güzel.\" – Apart from that, the color coverage is very good.\n\nSo the user likes the product's finish and color coverage but mentions using it only in winter. The mention of winter might be a negative point if they're implying it's not suitable for other seasons, but the overall sentiment seems positive because they highlight the good aspects. However, \"yalnızca kışın kullanacağım\" could indicate a limitation, which might be neutral or slightly negative. But since the rest is positive and the main points are about liking the product, maybe it's still POSITIVE. Need to check if there's any strong negative words. The text doesn't have obvious negatives; it's more about a specific use case. So probably NEUTRAL? Wait, but they say \"sevdiğim\" (I like) and \"gayet güzel\" (very good). Those are positive.

But later, their hair color went back to its original state.\n\nHmm, so there's a mix of emotions here. Initially negative because they weren't happy with the first result. Then positive when the color lightened, but then negative again when it reverted. The overall sentiment might be neutral because the experience had both positive and negative aspects that canceled each other out. But wait, the user ended up with their original hair color, which might mean they're back to square one. However, they did express happiness at one point. But since the final outcome was not satisfactory (reverted), maybe it's more negative? Or is it neutral because there were both positive and negative parts?\n\nWait, the key here is that the user tried again after reading reviews, which led to a temporary positive result but then reverted. The overall experience might be negative because the product didn't maintain the desired color. But they did have a moment of happiness. However, in sentiment analysis, we usually look at the overall outcome. Since the final state was back to original and not satisfactory, maybe it's more negative. Alternatively, if the user is neutral because they had mixed feelings but no clear positive or negative conclusion.\n\nBut looking at the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. So in this case, the user had both positive and negative experiences, leading to a neutral sentiment. The final outcome was not good, but there was a positive part.

The word \"kesmiyo\" is a colloquial form of \"kesmiyor\", which means \"doesn't cut\" or \"isn't cutting\". The sentence structure is negative because of the \"-yo\" ending, which is used in some Turkish dialects to indicate negation.\n\nNow, considering the context. If someone says \"Hiç kesmiyo\", they might be talking about something not happening at all. The word \"hiç\" means \"never\" or \"not even a little\". So combining \"hiç\" with \"kesmiyo\" could imply that something isn't happening, which might be negative. But I need to check if there's any positive or neutral context here.\n\nWait, but without more context, it's hard to tell the exact sentiment. However, the structure is negative. The user might be expressing dissatisfaction, like a service not being provided, or a problem that isn't being addressed. For example, if someone says \"Hiç kesmiyo\" about a product not working, that's negative. But if it's in a neutral context, maybe it's just stating a fact.\n\nBut according to the rules, I have to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user wrote: \"Zaten çıktığından beri kullanıyordum.yaz aylarında çok aksada.dokusu harika\". First, I need to break it down into parts.\n\nThe first part is \"Zaten çıktığından beri kullanıyordum.\" which translates to \"I've been using it since it came out.\" That's neutral because they're just stating a fact about their usage duration.\n\nNext, \"yaz aylarında çok aksada.\" means \"it's very scratchy in the summer months.\" The word \"aksada\" here is negative, indicating a problem with the product during certain times of the year. That's a negative point.\n\nThen, \"dokusu harika\" translates to \"the texture is amazing.\" This is clearly positive, highlighting a good aspect of the product.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. There are both negative and positive elements. However, the presence of a strong negative statement (\"çok aksada\") might tip the balance towards negative. But since there's also a positive comment, maybe it's neutral? Wait, but the user is pointing out a significant drawback (scratchiness in summer) which could be a major issue. The positive part is about texture, but if the product is scratchy during certain months, that's a functional problem. Depending on context, but generally, such issues would lean the sentiment towards negative. However, sometimes if there are both positives and negatives, it might be neutral. But in this case, the negative aspect seems more impactful. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user says they've been using it since it came out, which is neutral. Then mentions a problem during summer (negative), but also praises the texture (positive). It's a mix. However, the instruction says to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. If there are both positive and negative elements without one clearly overpowering the other, maybe it's neutral? But sometimes, if there's a complaint about functionality, that might be more negative. Alternatively, since they mention using it for a long time, maybe the overall sentiment is mixed but leaning towards negative because of the issue mentioned. However, the guidelines don't specify how to handle mixed sentiments. The examples given have clear positive or negative, but in this case, there's both. Maybe the presence of a complaint (negative) and a compliment (positive) makes it neutral? Or does the negative aspect take precedence?\n\nLooking at the example: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral because it's a balanced statement. Similarly, here, if there are both positive and negative points without one being more dominant, maybe it's neutral. But I'm not entirely sure. However, since the user mentions a specific problem (scratchiness in summer) which could be a significant downside, even though they like the texture, the overall sentiment might lean towards negative. Alternatively, if the product is used for a long time despite the issue, maybe it's more neutral. This is tricky.\n\nI think the key here is that the user points out a problem (negative) and a positive aspect. Since both are present, but there's no clear dominance of one over the other, the label should be NEUTRAL. However, if the negative part is more impactful, maybe NEGATIVE. But according to standard sentiment analysis practices, mixed sentiments without a clear majority might default to neutral. So I'll go with NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The mention of zero stars is pretty strong. In reviews, when someone says there are zero stars, that's usually a very negative sentiment. They're indicating the worst possible rating. Even saying that not even a single star is enough suggests extreme dissatisfaction. So, this is definitely a negative comment.

The text is: \"ayakları ölü derilerden arındırıcı etkisi var ama biraz fazla yağlı hissi var\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the sentence structure and the words used. The first part says \"ayakları ölü derilerden arındırıcı etkisi var\" which translates to something like \"it has an effect of removing dead skin from feet.\" That sounds positive because it's talking about a beneficial effect.\n\nThen there's the conjunction \"ama\" which means \"but,\" indicating a contrast. The second part is \"biraz fazla yağlı hissi var\" meaning \"there's a bit too much oily feeling.\" This part seems negative as it points out a drawback.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The sentence has both positive and negative elements. However, in sentiment analysis, when there's a contrast like this, the presence of a negative aspect after a positive one might tip the balance towards neutral or negative. But sometimes, if the positive part is strong enough, it could still be positive. \n\nBut looking at the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. That's a case where there's a mix of acceptance and neutrality. Similarly, here, the product has a beneficial effect but also a negative aspect. The user might be expressing that it's okay but with some drawbacks. \n\nSo considering both parts, the sentiment isn't strongly positive or negative. It's more of a mixed feeling, which would fall under NEUTRAL. The key is that there's no strong emphasis on either side; it's a balanced view with both pros and cons mentioned.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user is expressing satisfaction and praise. Even though there's a mention of the product being \"muhteşem,\" which is very positive, there's nothing contradicting that. \n\nSo combining both parts, the sentiment is clearly positive.

However, the second part is a positive suggestion. But in sentiment analysis, we usually look at the overall tone. Since the user is giving advice based on skin type and not expressing personal feelings about the product's quality, it might lean towards neutral. \n\nAlternatively, if the user were saying \"I don't like this product for oily skin,\" that would be negative.

The key parts are \"çok zor\" which means \"very difficult\" and \"renk veriyor\" which translates to \"giving color\" or \"coloring\". The context seems to be about applying something (maybe lipstick or a cosmetic product) multiple layers (\"kat kat sürmeme\") but it's still hard to get the right color, especially on the inner part of the lips.\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment.

The mention of \"özellikle dudagın ic orta kısmında\" (especially on the inner part of the lips) might be pointing out a specific issue but not necessarily a positive.\n\nComparing to the examples given: \"Zehirlendim.\" is negative, so similar frustration here.

But in context, it's more about expressing frustration rather than true neutrality. The overall tone is negative because the user is dissatisfied with the product's size and price.

The user is clearly not happy with whatever product or service they're talking about, comparing it unfavorably to Mankent and advising others against purchasing it.\n\nNow, checking the rules: I need to make sure I only output JSON without any extra text.

The user is talking about two aspects: the texture (kıvam) and the color (rengi). They mention that the texture didn't appeal to them (\"hoşuma gitmedi\"), which is a negative statement. Then they talk about the color being \"grimsi\" (which I think might be a typo for \"gri\" meaning gray?), and the edge (\"ucu\") not being as fine as in the image (\"çok ince değil\"). \n\nSo both parts of the sentence are pointing out negatives. The user is dissatisfied with both the texture and the appearance of the color and edge. There's no positive language here, just complaints. Therefore, the sentiment should be negative.\n\nI need to make sure there's no neutral or positive elements. Words like \"hoşuma gitmedi\" (didn't appeal) and \"çok ince değil\" (not very fine) are clearly negative.

The user is talking about something related to \"guneste\" which might be a typo or a specific term. Maybe they meant \"güneşte\" (in the sun)? But even if it's correct as \"guneste\", the context isn't clear. Then there's \"acilmasi kadar iyi değil\" – \"not as good as acilmasi\". \"Acilma\" could be a term related to something, maybe a product or process? Not sure.\n\nNext part: \"evde fon makinasiyla çok işe yaramiyor\" – \"doesn't help much with the home money machine\". Wait, \"fon makinasi\" might be a mistranslation. Maybe they meant \"fön makinesi\" (humidifier)? Or \"fon\" as in finance? But \"fon makinasi\" doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for \"föner\" or another term.\n\nAssuming the user is talking about a product that didn't perform well in the sun and isn't useful at home with whatever machine they're referring to. The sentiment here seems negative because they mention it's not as good as expected and doesn't help much. However, there's some ambiguity due to possible typos or unclear terms.

This suggests that the product didn't meet their expectations in terms of sizing. \n\nNow, looking at the possible labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. Since the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the fit, this would lean towards a negative sentiment. However, I should check if there's any positive aspect mentioned. The review only talks about the size being too large, no other positives are noted. \n\nBut wait, sometimes people might have mixed feelings. However, in this case, the entire comment is focused on the sizing issue, which is a negative experience. There's no indication of satisfaction or neutrality here.

The emoji here is a face with a frown and open mouth, which usually indicates disappointment or frustration.\n\nFirst, looking at the words: \"Keşke\" means \"if only,\" which sets up a wish or a desire for something that isn't currently possible. \"Renk seçebilsek\" translates to \"we could choose the color.\" The structure here is expressing a longing for an option that's not available. The use of \"seçebilsek\" (could choose) implies that the current situation doesn't allow for that choice.\n\nThe emoji 😒 adds to the sentiment. It's a face showing disappointment, which aligns with the feeling of frustration from not having the ability to choose the color. Even though the sentence is a wish, the underlying emotion here is negative because it's expressing a lack of satisfaction with the current options. \n\nNow, considering the labels: POSITIVE would be if there was joy or satisfaction, NEGATIVE for disappointment or frustration, and NEUTRAL for indifference.

So the first part is saying the fabric is terrible. Then, \"30 derecede yıkayınca kapri oldu.\" 30 degrees is a temperature, probably Celsius. \"Yıkayınca\" means when washed. \"Kapri\" might be a typo for \"kapan\" (closed) or \"kapri\" could be a name? Wait, maybe it's \"kapri\" as in the fabric shrank or became tight? Or maybe \"kapri\" is a misspelling of \"kapan\" meaning closed. But in context, when washing at 30 degrees, maybe the fabric shrank or got damaged. \n\nSo the user is complaining that the fabric was bad (berbat) and after washing at 30 degrees, it became worse (kapri oldu). The sentiment here seems negative because they're expressing dissatisfaction with the product's quality and its performance after washing.

So there's both negative and positive sentiments here. But according to the rules, I need to choose one label. The instructions mention that if there are mixed emotions, but the example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which translates to \"Okay considering the price,\" which is a neutral statement.\n\nIn this case, the user has both negative and positive points. However, the overall sentiment might be more neutral because they're pointing out a problem but still recommending the product. Alternatively, maybe it's mixed, but since the options are only POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL, I need to see which applies best.\n\nThe key here is that despite the negative aspects (bad packaging, leakage), the user ends with a positive recommendation. However, the presence of both negative and positive elements might make it neutral. But sometimes, if the overall intent is to recommend despite issues, it could be seen as positive. Wait, but the example given for neutral was when there's a balanced view, like \"okay considering the price.\" In this case, the user is pointing out flaws but still recommends the product. That might lean towards NEUTRAL because they're acknowledging both sides. However, another perspective is that the recommendation is positive, so maybe POSITIVE. But I need to check the rules again.\n\nThe user instructions say to use the labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The example for neutral was when there's a balanced statement. Here, the user has negative points but ends with a positive note. However, since there are both negative and positive elements, it might be considered mixed, but since we can't have mixed, maybe NEUTRAL is the safest choice here because they're not overwhelmingly positive or negative. Alternatively, if the recommendation is strong enough, it could be POSITIVE. But I think in this case, the presence of the negative aspects (bad packaging, leakage) which are significant issues, but the user still recommends it. So maybe NEUTRAL because they're acknowledging both pros and cons. However, another angle: the user's main sentiment is positive because they recommend the product despite the issues.

Translating to English, it's something like \"There should have been a discreet shipment. It would have been better if you didn't bother with packaging at all.\"\n\nFirst, looking at the sentiment words. The first part uses \"olmalıydı\" which is a past conditional, indicating a wish or regret that something wasn't done. The second sentence uses \"iyiydi\" which is a positive past tense, but in this context, it's used to express a hypothetical situation where not packaging would have been better. \n\nThe user is expressing dissatisfaction with the packaging process. They're suggesting that if there had been a discreet shipment and no packaging, it would have been better. This implies frustration or disappointment with the current situation. The use of \"zahmetinde de bulunmasanız\" (if you didn't bother with the hassle) shows annoyance.\n\nSo even though there's a positive word like \"iyiydi\", the overall sentiment here is negative because the user is complaining about the packaging and expressing that it should have been different.

The positive part is just a small thank you, which might not outweigh the main complaints.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Finally, they praise the fast shipping and good packaging, which is positive again.\n\nSo there are mixed sentiments here. The positives are about color, suitability, size, shipping, and packaging. The negatives are about the product's scent and value for money. But the overall tone seems to lean more towards neutral because while there are both positive and negative points, the user isn't overwhelmingly negative or positive.

However, they also say they bought it, which might be neutral or positive depending on context. But then they add that they couldn't use it, which is another negative aspect.\n\nSo there are two negatives here: disliking the smell and being unable to use the product. The fact that they bought it doesn't necessarily indicate a positive sentiment because the outcome was negative (couldn't use it). \n\nThe overall sentiment seems negative because the main points are about dissatisfaction with the product's smell and inability to use it, which are both negative experiences.

The user says \"galiba\" which means \"probably\" or \"I think\", indicating some uncertainty. Then they say \"hi güzel kokmuyor\" which translates to \"it doesn't smell good anymore\". \n\nThe key here is the negative sentiment towards the product's smell. Even though there's uncertainty about the content changing, the main complaint is about the odor. Words like \"kokmuyor\" (doesn't smell) and the context of a change leading to a less pleasant smell point towards a negative experience.

First, I need to understand the Turkish sentence. \"Alınabilir\" means \"can be bought\" or \"is available for purchase.\" So the sentence is saying \"Deodorant can be bought.\"\n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The word \"alınabilir\" is neutral in terms of positive or negative connotation. It's stating a fact about availability. There's no explicit positive or negative emotion here. The user isn't expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction; they're just informing that deodorant is available.\n\nI should check if there are any implicit sentiments. Sometimes, depending on context, but in this case, it's straightforward. No words like \"harika\" (great) or \"zehirlendim\" (poisoned) which would indicate positive or negative.

First, I need to analyze this in Turkish.\n\nThe phrase starts with \"bir fark olmadı\", which translates to \"there was no difference\" or \"it didn't matter\". Then there's \"sacimda\", which might be a typo. Maybe they meant \"saçımdaydı\" (was on my hair) or another word? But even if it's a typo, the main part is \"bir fark olmadı\".\n\nIn Turkish, when someone says \"bir fark olmadı\", it usually expresses that something didn't make a difference, which can be neutral. However, depending on context, it could have a negative connotation if they're disappointed.

The text is: \"Istıkrarla surersenız manıkure gerek kalmadıgını gorecegınız mucıZevı ürün\". First, I need to understand what the text is saying.\n\nBreaking it down, \"Istıkrarla surersenız\" translates to \"If you persist with consistency\" or \"If you continue steadily.\" Then \"manıkure gerek kalmadıgını gorecegınız\" means \"you will see that there's no need for a manicure.\" The last part is \"mucıZevı ürün,\" which seems like a product name, possibly \"Mucizevi Ürün\" (miraculous product).\n\nSo the sentence is saying that if you use this product consistently, you won't need a manicure anymore. The user is probably talking about a skincare or nail product that prevents the need for regular manicures. \n\nNow, looking at the sentiment. The words used are positive: \"mucıZevı\" (miraculous) and the implication that the product solves a problem (no need for manicures). There's no negative language here.

The sentiment here seems negative because they're expressing dissatisfaction with the product's effect on their skin. They mention a negative outcome (acne and pimples) and the result is not using the product anymore. \n\nI should check if there's any positive or neutral elements, but the main points are about the negative effects.

Then \"iste\" might be a contraction of \"için\" (for) or part of a phrase like \"iste de\" which can mean \"well then\" or \"so be it.\" The main part here is \"ortalama bir ürün,\" which translates to \"an average product.\" \n\nThe user is talking about a product being average.

So the sentence is saying this product is something everyone must have.\n\nNow, considering the sentiment. When someone says a product is necessary for everyone, that's usually a positive statement.

Then \"yağlı bir cildiniz varsa çok seversiniz\" translates to \"if you have oily skin, you'll love it very much.\" \n\nSo the user is talking about a product they've been using for a long time, and they're saying that if someone has oily skin, they would really like it. The sentiment here seems positive because they're recommending the product, especially for people with oily skin. Words like \"seversiniz\" (you'll love) indicate a positive feeling.\n\nBut wait, is there any negative connotation? The sentence doesn't mention any drawbacks or negative experiences.

Then they mention buying it during a discount, which could be neutral, but combined with the positive adjective, it's still positive. The part about it arriving quickly is another positive point.

The user mentions using a product or service but not experiencing any results. This could indicate dissatisfaction, which might lean towards negative. However, it's important to check if there's any positive or neutral nuance.\n\nThe phrase \"etki görmedim\" suggests disappointment or lack of effectiveness. If someone is using something and expecting results but isn't seeing them, that's typically a negative experience. There's no explicit positive language here, like words indicating satisfaction or benefit. \n\nHowever, the user might be neutral if they're just stating a fact without expressing strong feelings.

The user is expressing that their expectations were not met, leading to disappointment.\n\nEven though there's a mention of the photo (\"fotoğrafta göründüğü\"), the overall feeling conveyed is negative because they're talking about being disappointed.

Similarly, \"Normal sünger\" doesn't have any positive or negative adjectives. It's just stating a fact without expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction. There's no emotional language here.

That seems positive, showing determination. Then they mention \"indirimde yakaladım\" meaning \"I caught it on sale\", which is a good thing because getting a product on sale is usually seen as a positive experience. Finally, \"süper bir ürün\" translates to \"a super product\", where \"süper\" is definitely a strong positive adjective.\n\nPutting it all together, the user is expressing satisfaction with the product they bought on sale and their determination not to give up, which reinforces the positive sentiment.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user wrote, \"Çok pahalı ama çabuk geldi.\" Translating that to English, it's \"Very expensive but arrived quickly.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The sentence has two parts connected by \"ama,\" which means \"but.\" The first part is negative: \"çok pahalı\" (very expensive). The second part is positive: \"çabuk geldi\" (arrived quickly).\n\nNow, the challenge is determining whether the overall sentiment is more negative, positive, or neutral. Since there's a contrast between the two parts, I need to see which part has a stronger influence. In many cases, when there's a contradiction like this, the sentiment might lean towards negative if the main issue (price) is a significant factor. However, sometimes the presence of a positive aspect can balance it out.\n\nBut according to standard sentiment analysis rules, if there are both positive and negative elements without clear dominance, it might be neutral. However, in some contexts, the negative part might overpower the positive. But here, the user is pointing out two separate aspects: price and delivery speed. Since they're different factors, maybe the overall sentiment isn't strongly negative or positive but a mix. However, the instruction says to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nLooking at examples given earlier, for instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (Okay for the price) was neutral. In this case, the user is complaining about the price but praising the delivery speed. Since both aspects are present and neither clearly dominates, it might be considered neutral. However, sometimes the negative part can make the whole sentiment negative if the main point of the review is about the price being too high despite quick delivery.\n\nBut I think in this case, since there's a clear contrast between two different factors (price vs. delivery time), and both are mentioned without one being more emphasized than the other, it's safer to label it as NEUTRAL. The user isn't expressing strong dissatisfaction or satisfaction overall; they're just stating two facts.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

They end with being very satisfied (\"memnumum\") with the product.\n\nBut I need to check if there's any negative sentiment. The mention of \"siyah nok\" (black dots) might be a negative point, but the overall effect is positive.

That's usually a positive sign because people don't keep using something they dislike. Then \"bir ürün\" is \"a product.\" The next part is \"kesinlikle tavsiye ederim,\" which translates to \"definitely recommend it.\" The word \"kesinlikle\" is very strong, showing certainty and enthusiasm.\n\nLooking for positive words: \"tavsiye ederim\" (recommend) is a clear indicator of satisfaction.

Maybe if the context was different, but in this case, the sentence structure is straightforward.

Zaman geçtikçe güncelleyeceğim yorumu\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person is talking about using a product (probably skincare or something applied on hands and feet) for two days. They mention that there's no difference yet. Then they say they'll update the review as time passes.\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment. The key parts are \"henüz fark yok\" which translates to \"no difference yet.\" That sounds negative because they're not seeing any effect after two days. However, they also mention they'll update the review later, which might indicate some hope or intention to check again. But the current sentiment is about the lack of results so far.\n\nThe user's instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since the person is expressing dissatisfaction with the product not working yet, that leans towards NEGATIVE. However, if there's no clear positive or negative emotion, it might be neutral. But in this case, \"fark yok\" (no difference) is a negative statement. Even though they're planning to update later, the current sentiment is negative.\n\nWait, but maybe they're just stating facts without strong emotions? The user might not be happy, but are they explicitly expressing a negative emotion? The text doesn't have strong words like \"kötü\" or \"memnun değilim,\" but the lack of effect could imply disappointment. However, in some contexts, people might be neutral if they're just reporting no change yet without strong feelings.\n\nBut according to the example given, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is NEUTRAL. So if there's a statement that's not clearly positive or negative but more of an observation, it's neutral. However, in this case, the user might be implying that the product isn't effective yet, which could be seen as negative.\n\nHmm. The challenge here is whether \"henüz fark yok\" is a negative sentiment or just a neutral statement. If the person is expecting results and hasn't seen them yet, it's more likely to be negative. But if they're just stating that there's no difference without any emotional weight, maybe neutral. However, in product reviews, not seeing results often indicates dissatisfaction.\n\nI think the correct label here is NEGATIVE because the user is expressing that after two days, there's still no effect, which might indicate disappointment or lack of satisfaction with the product's performance so far.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

However, the second part introduces a negative aspect. The phrase \"ama koyu tenlilere yakışmaz\" translates to \"but doesn't suit dark-skinned people.\" This seems like a criticism, indicating that the product has a drawback related to its suitability for certain skin tones.\n\nNow, I need to determine the overall sentiment. The user starts with a positive comment but then points out a negative aspect. In such cases, the dominant sentiment can be tricky. However, since the negative part is a significant con, it might tip the balance towards negative. But sometimes, if the positive and negative are balanced, it could be neutral.\n\nBut looking at the structure: \"güzel bir ürün\" (positive) followed by \"ama...\" (but), which introduces a contrast. The use of \"ama\" often signals that the second part is a counterpoint to the first.

Since the user mentions both, but the negative part is a specific issue that might be more impactful in terms of overall satisfaction, I would lean towards \"NEGATIVE.\" However, if the analysis requires strict neutrality when both sides are present, it could be neutral.

The user mentions starting to use something, which is neutral. Then they say \"işe yarar\" (useful) and \"güzel yorumlar var\" (there are good reviews). Both of these are positive statements.

The text is: \"makyaj altı için çok güzel nem veriyor makyaj yapmadığım zamanlarda günlük kullaniyorum\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The person is talking about a product, probably a skincare item since they mention \"nem veriyor\" (provides moisture) and using it under makeup (\"makyaj altı\"). They also say they use it daily when not wearing makeup.\n\nLooking for positive words: \"çok güzel\" (very good) is definitely positive. The overall tone seems satisfied with the product's performance. There's no negative language here, just a neutral statement about usage. But since they're complimenting the product's effectiveness, that leans towards positive. \n\nWait, but the user might be using it daily even when not wearing makeup. Does that imply any dissatisfaction? Not necessarily. Maybe they find it beneficial for their skin regardless of makeup use.

The user is expressing that something wasn't pleasant. Words like \"gitmedi\" (didn't go) and the use of \"pek\" which softens the negative, but still indicates a negative feeling. So this should be classified as NEGATIVE. I need to make sure there's no neutral here because even though it's not strongly negative, the overall sentiment is still negative. The example given in the instructions had similar cases where \"zehirlendim\" (I got poisoned) was clearly negative, and \"fiyatına göre okey\" was neutral.

That sounds negative. Then they mention \"gözenekleri kapatmada bir benefit olmasa da bence başarılı,\" which translates to even though there's no benefit in closing pores, they think it's successful. So here, despite the initial problem, they acknowledge some success, which might be neutral or slightly positive.\n\nNext part: \"çabuk yağlandırıyor\" means it quickly makes the skin oily. That's a negative point. Finally, \"fazla sürdüğünüzde fondötenle anlaşamıyor\" suggests that when applied too much, it doesn't agree with the foundation. Another negative aspect.\n\nPutting this all together: The user has mixed feelings. They mention some success but also several drawbacks like oiliness and compatibility issues with foundation. However, the overall sentiment seems more negative because the negatives are specific and impactful (oiliness and foundation problems), while the positive is a general acknowledgment without strong praise.

However, sometimes context can change the sentiment. But here, there's no negative context. The user might be describing an object that's small but still useful, which is a positive trait.

The first sentence says that what was written in the reviews is true (\"Yorumlarda yazıldığı gibiymiş cidden\"). That's a positive statement because they're confirming the reviews are accurate.\n\nNext, \"Titreşimi ve boyutu çok iyi.\" translates to \"The vibration and size are very good.\" Both \"titreme\" (vibration) and \"boyut\" (size) are being praised here. The use of \"çok iyi\" is clearly positive.\n\nThen the last part: \"Bir haftada bile etkisini görmeye başladım.\" means \"I started seeing its effects within a week.\" This indicates that the product or service had an impact quickly, which is another positive point.\n\nThere's no negative language here. Words like \"cidden\" (truly), \"çok iyi\" (very good), and the mention of positive effects all contribute to a positive sentiment.

It says something like \"Very harsh not useful for eyes all the ones for the eyes are the same there's no wide-angle one.\" Wait, maybe the translation isn't perfect, but the key points are negative words like \"sert\" (harsh), \"kullanışlı değil\" (not useful), and \"aynı gibi\" (same), which might indicate dissatisfaction.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence: \"2 yıldır\" means \"for two years\", indicating a long duration. \"Asla vazgeçemediğim\" translates to \"I couldn't let go\" or \"I never gave up\". The phrase \"asla vazgeçemediğim\" has a negative connotation because it's about not being able to stop something, which might imply frustration or persistence in a negative situation. However, the context isn't clear. If someone is talking about a bad habit they can't quit, that would be negative. But if it's about holding onto something positive, like a relationship, maybe it's neutral or even positive. \n\nBut without more context, the default assumption might lean towards negative because \"vazgeçmek\" (to give up) is often used in contexts of quitting bad things. However, the user hasn't provided enough information. The sentence is incomplete; it ends with \"im\", which is a possessive suffix, so maybe the original sentence was cut off. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but considering common usage, I think the sentiment here is likely negative. The person is expressing that they couldn't let go of something for two years, which might be a negative experience. But if it's about something positive, like a cherished item or memory, it could be neutral. However, without more context, the safest bet based on typical usage would be negative.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user is saying that at this price, 400ml is very good, which again points to a positive sentiment. There's no negative language here, just strong positive expressions.

Let me break it down. \"Acik ton\" might be \"açık ton\" which means \"light tone\" or \"pale color\". Then \"daha koyu\" is \"more dark\" or \"darker\". The last part \"saniyodm\" looks like a typo. Maybe they meant \"sanıyodum\" which would be \"I thought\" in past continuous tense. So putting it together: \"Light tone is more dark, I thought.\" That doesn't make much sense. Maybe there's a misunderstanding or a typo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to say something else but made spelling mistakes. For example, \"acik ton daha koyu saniyodm\" could be a mix of words. If it's about color tones, perhaps they meant that a light tone is actually darker than expected? But the sentence structure is confusing.\n\nSince the text is unclear and possibly contains typos, it's hard to determine the sentiment. The user might have intended to express confusion or dissatisfaction due to the typo, but without more context, it's tricky. However, based on the given information, there's no clear positive or negative emotion expressed.

The person is saying that there's aluminum in something they bought (\"Bundada alüminyum varmış\"), which made them regret their purchase (\"aldığıma pişman oldum\"). The word \"pişman\" translates to regret or remorse, which is a strong indicator of negative sentiment. They're expressing dissatisfaction with the product because it contains aluminum, which might be unexpected or undesirable for them. \n\nI should check if there's any ambiguity. The sentence structure is straightforward. The mention of aluminum could be a negative aspect depending on context, like if they were expecting something else. Since they explicitly state regret, that leans heavily towards negative. No positive words are present here. Neutral would be if they were just stating a fact without emotion, but \"pişman\" adds the emotional weight. So the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

First, I need to understand what this sentence means. \"Iade yapmak\" translates to \"to return\" or \"to refund,\" and \"istiyorum\" is \"I want.\" So the whole sentence is \"I want to return [something].\" \n\nNow, determining the sentiment here. The user is expressing a desire to return something, which could be a product, service, or money. In many contexts, wanting to return something might indicate dissatisfaction, like a negative experience leading to a refund request. However, sometimes people might want to return an item for other reasons, like changing their mind, which isn't necessarily negative.\n\nBut in the absence of additional context, the default assumption is that wanting to return something is associated with a negative sentiment. For example, if someone is returning a product because it didn't meet expectations, that's a negative experience. However, there are neutral cases too, like returning an item for a different size or color without any issues. But since the user hasn't provided more context, I have to go with the most common interpretation.\n\nLooking at the example given in the instructions: \"Zehirlendim.\" (I got poisoned) is labeled as NEGATIVE. Similarly, \"Iade yapmak istiyorum\" implies a negative experience because it's about returning something, which usually stems from dissatisfaction. Therefore, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The key phrases are \"fiyatına göre\" (considering the price), \"çok iş görüyor\" (doing quite well), and \"memnun kaldım\" (I'm satisfied). All of these are positive indicators. The user is expressing satisfaction with the product or service, especially in relation to its price. They're not complaining or showing any negative emotions. \n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden negative meaning, but in this case, it seems straightforward.

No need to consider NEUTRAL because the adjectives used are explicitly positive. NEGATIVE is out of the question here.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe think about other possible interpretations.

They expected a version with pockets based on the image, but received a pocketless one instead.

The user mentions that after three months, an error occurred (\"eror verdi\"), they took it out (\"çıkardım\"), and are now using the plastic manually (\"plastiğini manuel olarak kullanıyorum\"). They end with \"napayim\", which is a question like \"what can I do?\".\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment. The main points here are negative: an error occurred after three months, they had to remove it, and now they're using it manually, which might be a workaround. The last part is a question expressing frustration or seeking help. There's no positive language here. Even though they found a solution (using it manually), the overall context seems negative because of the problem encountered.\n\nSo, the sentiment should be NEGATIVE. I need to make sure there are no neutral words that might tip it the other way. Words like \"eror\", \"çıkardım\", \"manuel olarak\" all point towards a negative experience.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. The person is talking about their hair being made curly (türüncu) and hardened (sertleştirdi). Now, in Turkish, \"türüncu\" can mean wavy or curly, which might be a positive trait depending on context. However, \"sertleştirdi\" means hardened, which could have negative connotations if it's about the hair feeling too stiff or damaged.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user is using these terms in a neutral way. They're just stating what was done to their hair without expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction. The sentence doesn't include any explicit positive words like \"harika\" (great) or negative words like \"zehirlendim\" (poisoned). It's more of a factual statement about the effects on their hair.\n\nHowever, in some contexts, making hair curly and hard might be seen as undesirable, especially if it's not what they wanted. But without any emotional language, it's hard to tell. The user might be neutral because they're just reporting the outcome without judgment. Alternatively, if the result was unexpected or unwanted, that could lean negative.

But then they say \"temizliğini ne bileyim bilemedim\" meaning \"I can't tell about its cleanliness.\" That's a bit negative because they're unsure about the cleanliness.\n\nNext, they mention \"Lavabonun içini temizlerdim hep.\" which is \"I always cleaned the inside of the sink.\" This could be a positive point if they're emphasizing their own thoroughness, but it might also indicate that the product didn't meet their expectations since they had to clean it themselves.\n\nThen, \"Alınca hemen denedim. Ama umduğum gibi olmadı.\" translates to \"As soon as I got it, I tried it. But it didn't turn out as I hoped.\" This is clearly negative because the outcome wasn't what they expected.\n\nPutting this all together, there are mixed elements.

The user provided the text: \"Fiyatın düşmesini beklemenizi tavsiye ederim.\" I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The person is advising someone to wait for the price to drop. The key words here are \"fiyatın düşmesini\" (price dropping) and \"tavsiye ederim\" (I recommend). \n\nNow, considering the context. If someone is suggesting waiting for a price decrease, that could imply that the current price is high or not favorable. However, the sentiment isn't explicitly negative. The person might be giving advice based on expectation of a future drop, which could be seen as neutral because they're just stating a recommendation without expressing personal dissatisfaction.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's an underlying implication. If the speaker thinks the price should go down, does that indicate a negative view of the current price? However, in many contexts, advising to wait for a lower price is a common practice and doesn't necessarily carry a negative sentiment. It's more about timing rather than dissatisfaction.\n\nAlternatively, if the recommendation is based on the expectation that the price will drop, it might be neutral because they're not expressing a strong positive or negative emotion. They're just providing advice. \n\nI should also consider examples given earlier. For instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled neutral. That's similar to this case where the user is commenting on the price but in a way that's not clearly positive or negative.

If the product is supposed to be large, like a piece of furniture, then it's positive. But if it's something that should be small, like a phone, then it might be negative. However, without additional context, the default assumption is that being big is a positive trait unless stated otherwise. So the sentiment here is likely positive.

The key phrase is \"fena değildi,\" which translates to \"wasn't bad\" or \"not bad.\" That's a positive statement, but it's tempered by \"fiyatına göre,\" meaning \"for the price.\" This suggests that while the product or service wasn't terrible, the user is emphasizing that it was acceptable given its cost. \n\nNow, looking at the possible labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The user isn't expressing strong dissatisfaction (which would be negative) or strong satisfaction (positive). Instead, they're giving a neutral assessment based on the price. Even though \"fena değildi\" is somewhat positive, the context of comparing it to the price makes the overall sentiment more neutral. It's not a bad experience, but also not an excellent one. The user is just stating that it met their expectations considering the cost.\n\nI should check if there are any other nuances. Maybe the user is hinting at something else, but based on the given text, there's no indication of strong positive or negative emotions. The main point is the balance between quality and price.

The word \"ideal\" is positive. But the context is about a specific group of people (those who like yellow underwear). However, there's no explicit positive or negative emotion expressed beyond stating a fact.

However, the sentence is addressing a specific group and stating a fact about their preference. Since it's not expressing an opinion beyond that, maybe it's neutral. The user might be trying to say that for people who like yellow underwear, these are ideal, which is a neutral observation.

First, I need to understand the Turkish words here.\n\n\"Başarılı\" means successful or successful, which is positive. Then there's \"fakat,\" which is \"but\" in English, indicating a contrast. The second part is \"çok toz,\" which translates to \"a lot of dust.\" In context, \"toz\" could be literal dust, but maybe it's used metaphorically here. However, without more context, I should take it literally.\n\nSo the sentence starts with a positive word but then mentions a negative aspect (dust). The user might be talking about a product that's successful but has a lot of dust, which could be a negative point. But since \"toz\" is neutral in some contexts, like in a factory setting, maybe it's not necessarily negative. However, the presence of \"fakat\" suggests that the second part is a drawback. \n\nIn sentiment analysis, when there's a contrast with \"fakat,\" the overall sentiment might lean towards negative if the second part is more impactful. But since \"toz\" isn't inherently negative, maybe it's neutral. However, the user might be implying that the dust is an issue. \n\nWait, but the instruction says to use only POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The example for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey,\" which is a balanced statement. Here, the sentence has both positive and negative elements. But how does that translate? If it's a mix, maybe it's neutral. However, sometimes in Turkish, when you have a positive followed by a negative with \"fakat,\" the overall sentiment can be seen as negative because the second part is a criticism. \n\nBut I need to check if \"çok toz\" is considered negative. If someone says a product is successful but has a lot of dust, maybe they're pointing out a flaw. So the overall sentiment might be negative. However, without knowing the context of \"toz,\" it's tricky. But according to standard analysis, combining positive and negative with \"fakat\" often leads to a more negative sentiment. \n\nAlternatively, if \"toz\" is neutral, like in a factory, then maybe the sentence is neutral. But I think the user intended it as a negative aspect. So the label would be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

I need to analyze the sentiment here.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. The key parts are \"ilk kullandığınızda bile\" which means \"even when you first use it\", \"yüzde renk eşitliğini sağladığını\" translates to \"achieves color uniformity%\", and \"fark ediyorsunuz\" is \"you notice\". \n\nThe user is talking about a product, probably something related to skin care or makeup, since color uniformity is mentioned. The phrase \"bile\" (even) emphasizes that even on the first use, the product achieves color uniformity. That sounds positive because it's highlighting an effective feature right from the start.\n\nThere's no negative language here. Words like \"fark ediyorsunuz\" suggest a positive experience since noticing the effect is a good thing. The sentence structure doesn't indicate any complaints or dissatisfaction. \n\nSo, the sentiment should be positive. The user is pointing out a benefit of the product without any negative connotations. Therefore, the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The sentence structure is straightforward, just stating that the product is useful without any negative qualifiers.\n\nI should check if there's any hidden sarcasm or context that might change the sentiment, but in Turkish, sarcasm isn't as commonly expressed through text alone. The phrase seems genuine. \n\nComparing to the examples given: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" (Positive), \"Zehirlendim.\" (Negative), \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (Neutral).

The words \"çok küçük\" mean \"very small,\" which is a negative descriptor in this context because the user is likely expecting something larger. Then, \"yoğun kapatıcılığı yok\" translates to \"no strong closure,\" which also sounds negative. They're pointing out two flaws: size and lack of closure.\n\nLooking at the labels, POSITIVE would be if they were happy with the product, but here both points are criticisms.

However, the context might matter. The phrase \"bıraktığı doku\" refers to the texture left behind, which could be from something like food or a product. If someone is saying that the texture isn't bad, they're probably expressing satisfaction. But wait, sometimes in Turkish, \"fena değil\" can be neutral depending on context.

The negative part is about stiffness, but they mention it's the only problem.

They mention that when the color opens up a bit, it becomes pink, which they think is better. But when it opens more, it becomes too shiny. \n\nHmm, there's some positive and negative elements here. The initial part says \"biraz parlak açılınca pembe oluyor o zaman daha iyi\" – so when it's slightly opened, it turns pink and that's better. That sounds positive. But then they say \"daha çok açılınca da parlaklasmis gibi\" – if it opens more, it becomes too shiny, which is negative.\n\nBut the overall sentiment? The user seems to be giving a balanced view. They mention both positive (pink when slightly opened) and negative (too shiny when more opened). However, the main point might be that there's a preference for the pink tone but not when it's overly shiny. \n\nIn Turkish sentiment analysis, sometimes the presence of both positive and negative can lead to neutral if they balance each other. But I need to check if the overall tendency is more positive or negative. The user says \"daha iyi\" (better) when slightly opened, which is a positive statement. However, the negative part is about an undesirable effect when overdone. \n\nBut since the user is expressing that there's a better outcome in one scenario and a worse in another, but not clearly stating overall satisfaction or dissatisfaction. It might lean towards neutral because they're discussing both sides without a clear preference. Alternatively, if the positive aspect is more emphasized, maybe positive. But the mention of the negative effect when overdone could make it neutral.\n\nWait, the user starts with \"göründüğü gibi renk tonu fakat biraz parlak açılınca pembe oluyor o zaman daha iyi ama daha çok açılınca da parlaklasmis gibi\". The structure is: initial observation (renk tonu), then a condition where it becomes better, but another condition where it's worse. \n\nThe key here is that the user is pointing out both pros and cons.

So the whole phrase is saying something like \"it's very transparent in showing the inside\".\n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The word \"şeffaf\" (transparent) can be positive or negative depending on context. If it's about honesty or clarity, it's positive. But if it's about something being too exposed or vulnerable, it might be negative. However, in this case, the phrase is neutral.

Then they mention applying shampoo without wetting the hair and being confident that the user will be satisfied.\n\nWait, there's a part where they say \"Her yazılana inanmayın\" which means \"Don't believe everything written.\" That might indicate some skepticism or caution, but the overall sentiment seems positive because they're praising the product's effectiveness.

However, the phrase \"tek ürün\" (only product) might imply that there's no other option or that it's the sole solution.

However, here the focus is on achieving max performance with that single product, which might be seen as a good thing. The user isn't complaining; they're stating a fact about the product's capability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is implying that there are no other products available or that it's the only one needed, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, based solely on the given text, the key positive term is \"max performans,\" which leans towards positive sentiment. The use of \"tek ürün\" doesn't necessarily add a negative aspect here.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the user's query. The text provided is \"İşe yarıyor,\" which translates to \"It's useful\" or \"It works\" in English. The task is to determine the sentiment label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the phrase. \"İşe yarıyor\" is a positive expression indicating that something is effective or functional. In Turkish, this phrase is commonly used to express satisfaction with a product or service's utility. There's no negative connotation here; it's straightforwardly positive. The user might be referring to a product working as intended, which would naturally lead to a positive sentiment.\n\nI should check if there are any nuances I'm missing. Sometimes, depending on context, phrases can have different meanings, but in this case, \"İşe yarıyor\" is pretty direct. There's no sarcasm or hidden meaning indicated. The user hasn't provided additional context that might alter the sentiment, so sticking with POSITIVE makes sense.\n\nComparing to the examples given: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" (POSITIVE) and \"Zehirlendim.\" (NEGATIVE). \"İşe yarıyor\" is similar to the first example in that it's a clear positive statement. The third example, \"Fiyatına göre okey,\" is neutral because it's a matter-of-fact comment about price. Here, the user's statement is more about functionality, which is a strong positive indicator.\n\nTherefore, the correct label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

First, I'll read through the text carefully.\n\nThe user starts by saying they heard that Sleepy's content is clean, so they bought it out of curiosity. But then they mention that inside there's a lot of alcohol and acid, which sounds negative. They also say the cotton is very harsh, which adds to the negative aspects. Finally, they state they don't think they'll buy it again. \n\nLooking at the keywords: \"gayet alkolde var asitte var\" (there's a lot of alcohol and acid) and \"Mendili de gayet sert\" (the cotton is very harsh). These are clearly negative points. The initial curiosity (\"merak ederek aldım\") is positive, but the overall experience is negative. The conclusion that they won't buy it again reinforces the negative sentiment.\n\nSo even though there's a slight positive mention at the beginning, the majority of the review focuses on negative aspects.

First, I need to analyze this in Turkish.\n\n\"Piline göre\" translates to \"according to the pilot\" or \"as per the pilot\". Then \"güçü var\" means \"has power\" or \"there is power\". So putting it together, it's saying something like \"According to the pilot, there is power.\" \n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The sentence itself is stating a fact based on the pilot's statement. There's no explicit positive or negative language here. Words like \"güç\" (power) are neutral in this context. The structure doesn't express satisfaction, dissatisfaction, or any strong emotion. It's more of a factual statement.\n\nConsidering the rules, if there's no clear positive or negative sentiment, it should be labeled as NEUTRAL. The example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is similar in that it's a neutral observation without emotional charge. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any hidden context. Maybe \"piline\" refers to something specific, but without more information, it's safest to stick with the literal translation. No exclamation marks or emotive words here.

The user is talking about a product (probably skincare) that moisturizes the skin very well. \n\nThe adjectives used are positive: \"güzel\" is definitely positive, and \"çok\" intensifies it. The verb \"nemlendiriyor\" is a positive effect on the skin. There's no negative language here.

Then \"kokusu güzel\" means \"the smell is nice,\" which is also positive. \"Ve yumuşacık yapıyor\" is \"and it makes it soft,\" which could be neutral, but in context, it's probably a positive attribute, like the product is gentle or comfortable.\n\nSo all parts of the sentence are positive. There's no negative language here. The user is clearly satisfied with the product, mentioning both the scent and the texture positively. Even \"yumuşacık\" (soft) is a good thing in this context.

However, they follow up with \"ama dayanilmicak gibi değil,\" meaning \"but it doesn't seem unbearable.\" This part is more neutral or even slightly positive because they're downplaying the heat issue.\n\nSo, there's a mix of positive and neutral elements. The initial praise is strong, but the negative aspect is mitigated by the user's own assessment that it's not too bad. Since the overall tone seems to lean towards satisfaction despite the minor inconvenience, the label should be \"POSITIVE.\" But wait, maybe I should check if the negative part is significant enough to tip the scale.

Then there's \"düzrnli kullamama rağmen\" which might be a typo for \"düzgün kullanmama rağmen\" meaning \"despite not using properly.\" The last part is \"şaşırttı\" which means \"surprised me.\"\n\nPutting it all together: The user expected something better, but despite not using it correctly, it still surprised them. The surprise could be positive or negative. However, the initial statement is negative (\"not as good as expected\"), and the surprise might be a positive outcome.

The user wrote, \"Kokusu çok güzel ama aşırı küçük 1 ay anca dayanır.\" Translating that to English: \"The smell is very nice but it's too small and only lasts for a month.\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The first part, \"Kokusu çok güzel\" is clearly positive. They're complimenting the scent. But then there's \"ama aşırı küçük 1 ay anca dayanır,\" which translates to \"but it's too small and only lasts for a month.\" The word \"ama\" means \"but,\" so this introduces a negative aspect.\n\nNow, the challenge is determining whether the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The user starts with a positive comment but follows it with two negatives: the product being too small and not lasting long enough. However, the structure of the sentence uses \"ama\" which contrasts the two parts. In some cases, if the positive part is strong enough, it might tip the scale, but here the negatives are specific issues that could affect satisfaction.\n\nBut looking at the example given in the instructions, a similar case was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which was neutral. However, in this case, there's a mix of positive and negative. But maybe the key is whether the negatives outweigh the positives. The user mentions two drawbacks but only one positive. However, the instruction examples might have different criteria.\n\nWait, the example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is more of a balanced statement. Here, the user has both positive and negative points. But in sentiment analysis, sometimes mixed sentiments can be considered neutral if they balance out. However, other times, the presence of any negative aspect might make it negative, especially if the negatives are significant.\n\nBut looking at the examples again: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" is positive, \"Zehirlendim.\" is negative, and \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. So in this case, the user has both positive and negative aspects. However, the instruction might consider that if there's a mix but no clear dominance, it's neutral. Alternatively, maybe the presence of any negative aspect makes it negative. But I need to check the rules again.\n\nThe user instructions say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The example with \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral because it's a balanced statement. In this case, the user has both positive and negative points but doesn't clearly lean one way. However, sometimes in such cases, if there are more negatives, it might be considered negative. But here, the first part is positive, then two negatives. However, the structure of the sentence uses \"ama\" which introduces a contrast, so maybe the overall sentiment is negative because the user is pointing out significant drawbacks despite the initial positive comment.\n\nAlternatively, since both positive and negative aspects are present, it might be neutral. But I need to think about standard sentiment analysis practices. Typically, if there's a mix of sentiments without clear dominance, it can be considered neutral. However, sometimes the presence of any negative aspect could make it negative. But in this case, the user is expressing both satisfaction and dissatisfaction. So maybe the correct label here is NEUTRAL because it's a mixed sentiment.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The key words are \"küçük\" (small) and \"güzel\" (nice). The user is talking about using a cleaning gel, which might be for a specific product. They mention pouring it into the product and using it that way. The phrase \"küçük ama güzel\" translates to \"small but nice,\" which seems positive.

The overall tone seems to be satisfied with the product despite its small size.\n\nSo, the sentiment is likely positive because the user ends with a positive remark about the product being nice.

The comment about the color being nice adds a positive aspect.\n\nBut overall, the main sentiment seems to lean towards negative because the user didn't like the product due to their specific needs (dry skin), even though there are some positives. However, since they mention it might be good for others, maybe neutral? Wait, but the primary experience here is negative. The user's personal dissatisfaction is stronger than the positive aspects mentioned. So probably NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The use of strong negative words like \"berbat\" and the description of things not fitting well (\"dipileri tutuyor uçlar alakasız\") indicate frustration.

The verb \"kapatıyor\" is interesting. In Turkish, \"kapamak\" can mean closing something, but in this context, maybe it's slang or a specific usage. Wait, could it be related to a business or service? Like closing a deal or ending a conversation? But the user didn't provide context.\n\nHowever, looking at the example given by the user: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" was labeled as POSITIVE.

The user says, \"Ürünü beğenerek kullanıyorum tek sıkıntım ürün yollanırken iyi sarılmamış bu yüzden akmiş.\" Translating that to English: \"I like using the product, but my only problem is that it wasn't well wrapped when shipped, so it got damaged.\"\n\nFirst, they start by saying they like the product, which is positive. But then they mention an issue with the packaging leading to damage. The main complaint here is about the shipping and packaging, not the product itself. However, the overall sentiment might be negative because the user had a bad experience due to the poor packaging. Even though they like the product, the negative aspect of the delivery process could make the overall sentiment lean towards negative. But wait, maybe it's neutral? Because they still use the product and are satisfied with it, but the problem is with the shipping. However, in reviews, if there's a complaint about the service or packaging, even if the product itself is good, the overall sentiment might be considered negative. Alternatively, since the user is still using the product and the main issue is not the product quality but the delivery, maybe it's neutral. But I need to check the rules again. The labels are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. If there's a mix of positive and negative elements, how do we decide? The example given for \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is NEUTRAL. So if the user has both positive and negative points but no clear overall sentiment, it might be neutral. However, in this case, the main issue is the damage due to poor packaging, which could be seen as a negative experience. But since they still like the product, maybe it's mixed. Wait, but the instruction says to analyze the text and assign one label. The user mentions a problem with the shipping, which affects their experience negatively. Even though they like the product, the negative aspect of the delivery might make the overall sentiment negative. Alternatively, if the main focus is on the product being liked despite the issue, maybe neutral. Hmm. I think in this case, since the user had a negative experience with the packaging leading to damage, even though they like the product, the overall sentiment would be NEGATIVE because the complaint is about the service or delivery process, which is part of the customer experience. But sometimes, if the product itself is good but there's an issue with shipping, it might be considered neutral. However, looking at the examples provided: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is NEUTRAL. That example has a neutral sentiment because the user is okay with the price. In this case, the user has a positive comment about the product but a negative one about the packaging. Since the main complaint is about the service (shipping), which is part of the overall experience, maybe it's NEGATIVE. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: if the user is still using the product and the problem is with the delivery, perhaps the sentiment is more neutral because they are satisfied with the product but had an issue with shipping. However, in many cases, such complaints would be considered negative. Maybe the key here is that the user mentions a problem, which indicates dissatisfaction, hence NEGATIVE. But I need to check if the instruction considers mixed sentiments as NEUTRAL or if the presence of any negative aspect makes it NEGATIVE. The examples don't have mixed cases. For instance, \"Yemek harikaydı.\" is positive, and \"Zehirlendim.\" is negative. So in this case, since there's a mix, but the user still uses the product and likes it, maybe NEUTRAL. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the main point is that they had a problem with the packaging leading to damage, which is a significant issue, then NEGATIVE. Hmm. Maybe the answer should be NEGATIVE because the user is pointing out a problem that affected their experience. Even though they like the product, the negative aspect of the delivery process might make the overall sentiment negative.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Then \"kötü\" is \"bad\", and \"berbat\" is another word for \"terrible\" or \"awful\". Both of these are clearly negative adjectives. The phrase \"hatta almayın\" translates to \"don't even buy it\" or \"don't buy it at all\".

However, the second part mentions that because the package was opened, a return isn't possible. That sounds like a problem or inconvenience.\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"çok çok basit\" could indicate disappointment if the product didn't meet expectations. The mention of not being able to return it adds to the negative sentiment. Even though there's no explicit negative word like \"kötü\" or \"memnun değil\", the context suggests dissatisfaction with the product and the return policy.\n\nSo, combining both parts, the user is expressing a negative experience due to the product's simplicity and the inability to return it. Therefore, the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The sentence starts with \"iyi,\" which is positive. However, the second part mentions the smell being \"biraz ağır\" (a bit strong). This could be negative depending on context. But since it's qualified by \"biraz,\" it's a mild criticism.\n\nIn Turkish, when someone says something is good but has a minor drawback, the overall sentiment might lean towards neutral because the positive and negative aspects balance each other out. The user isn't strongly negative or positive; they're pointing out a flaw in an otherwise good product. \n\nSo, considering the structure of the sentence with \"ama\" (but), which introduces a contrast, but the negative part is softened by \"biraz,\" I think the appropriate label here is NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

First, I need to understand the Turkish sentence. \"Kötü\" means bad or poor, and \"almayın\" is a command form of \"almak,\" which means to take or buy. So the literal translation is \"Don't take/buy bad ones.\" \n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The word \"kötü\" is negative, but the sentence is advising against taking something bad. However, the context isn't clear. Is this a warning about a product being bad, or is it a recommendation to avoid something? If someone is telling others not to buy something because it's bad, that would be a negative sentiment towards the product. But if it's a general advice, maybe neutral?\n\nWait, but in Turkish, when someone says \"Kötü almayın,\" they might be warning others about a bad experience, which could imply a negative sentiment. However, the sentence itself is a command to avoid something bad, so the sentiment here is more likely negative because it's pointing out a problem. Alternatively, if the context was neutral, like advising caution without strong emotion, but \"kötü\" is clearly negative.\n\nLooking at the examples given: \"Zehirlendim.\" (I got poisoned) is labeled NEGATIVE. Similarly, \"Kötü almayın\" is advising against taking something bad, which would be a negative sentiment towards the product or service being referred to. So the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

However, the second part mentions being cautious about applying it around the eyes. This could indicate a minor concern or a negative aspect, but the user isn't expressing dissatisfaction directly. They're just being careful.\n\nNow, considering the rules for sentiment analysis here. The presence of both positive and neutral elements. The first part is definitely positive, but the second part is more about caution rather than a negative feeling. The user isn't complaining; they're just advising others to be careful. \n\nIn such cases, if there's a mix of positive and neutral sentiments without clear negativity, the overall sentiment might lean towards positive. However, sometimes the presence of any negative element could tip it to neutral. But in this case, the caution is more of a neutral note rather than a negative one. The user still likes the product but has a warning.\n\nLooking at the examples provided: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL because it's a balanced statement. Similarly, here, even though there's a positive part and a cautionary note, the overall sentiment isn't strongly negative.

However, it's good that it didn't get deleted immediately.\"\n\nBreaking it down, the user is talking about a product, probably a color. They mention that the actual color is brown, but they thought it was orange. There's a mistake here, but they're relieved it wasn't deleted right away. The key emotions here are frustration from the mistake but also relief that the issue wasn't made permanent. \n\nNow, looking at the sentiment labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The user is expressing both negative feelings about the error and positive about the resolution. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a mix, we usually go with the dominant emotion or look for overall tone. But since the instructions don't mention handling mixed sentiments, maybe it's better to see which part is stronger.\n\nThe main issue here is the mistake (negative), but the relief (positive) might balance it. However, in many cases, such feedback would be considered negative because the user had a problem even though there was a positive aspect. Alternatively, if the overall experience isn't clearly negative or positive, NEUTRAL could be an option. But the presence of both emotions complicates things.\n\nWait, but the example given for NEUTRAL is \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which translates to \"Okay considering the price,\" indicating a neutral stance. In this case, the user had a problem (wrong color) but was relieved it wasn't deleted. However, the main sentiment here might lean more towards negative because the mistake occurred, even though there's a positive note. But maybe the overall sentiment is mixed enough to be considered NEUTRAL.\n\nAlternatively, if the dominant emotion is relief, maybe POSITIVE? But that seems off. The user is pointing out an error, which is negative. However, they're happy it wasn't deleted immediately. It's tricky. In some cases, mixed sentiments might default to NEUTRAL if there's no clear dominance. So perhaps NEUTRAL is the safest choice here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Eh işte\" is a common Turkish expression that translates to something like \"Well, you know\" or \"It is what it is.\" It's often used to introduce a statement that might be somewhat dismissive or non-committal.\n\nNext, \"fena değil\" means \"not bad\" or \"okay.\" That part seems positive.

This could be a neutral statement because they're not overly positive or negative. They're just stating an observation based on the price.\n\nBut wait, \"fena değil\" is positive, but the overall sentiment might depend on context. If someone says something is \"not bad for the price,\" they might be implying that it's acceptable given the cost, which could lean neutral because there's no strong positive or negative emotion.

Then, after the first wash (\"ilk yıkama da\"), their face became soft (\"yüzümü yumuşacık yaptı\"). Words like \"yumuşacık\" (soft) are positive. \n\nSo both parts of the sentence are positive.

Hmm, \"ısıd\" is the past tense of \"ısıtmak\", which means to heat or warm up. The suffix \"-miyor\" is a negative present tense marker.

This would likely be a negative review.\n\nI need to make sure there's no ambiguity.

First, I need to understand the content.\n\nThe text starts with \"ürün çok uzun sürsde elime uladti gelmesi meredeyse 15 gün aldı\" which seems like they're talking about the product taking a long time to arrive, maybe 15 days. That's probably a negative point because delays are usually frustrating.\n\nThen they say \"ancak ürün gayet iyi daha önceden de kullandığım için tekrar sipariş verdim\" – here, they mention the product is good and they reordered it. Positive sentiment here.\n\nNext part: \"ancak çok kuru ciltlere uygun olduğunu düşünmuyorum biraz kuruluk yapıyo yağli ciltler için gayet iyi\". They're saying it's not suitable for dry skin, causes some dryness, but good for oily skin. This is a mixed sentiment. The user has a negative point about dry skin but positive for oily skin.\n\nNow, the challenge is to determine the overall label. The rules say if there are both positive and negative aspects, which one dominates? The initial delay (negative) and the product quality (positive). However, the user mentions they reordered because of the good product, indicating satisfaction despite the wait. But then they also mention a drawback for dry skin. \n\nBut the main sentiment here might lean more towards neutral because there are both positive and negative points without a clear dominance. The user is giving feedback on different aspects: delivery time (negative), product quality (positive), suitability for different skin types (mixed). Since the instructions say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL, and if it's mixed, maybe neutral? But sometimes, if there's more positive than negative, it could be positive. However, in this case, the delivery time is a significant negative factor, but the product itself is good. The user also mentions they reordered, which is a strong positive indicator. However, the negative about dry skin might not affect everyone. \n\nWait, the user says \"tekrar sipariş verdim\" (reordered), which shows satisfaction despite the delivery time and the issue with dry skin. So maybe overall it's more positive? But there's also the negative aspect of the product causing dryness for some. However, the user is giving a balanced review, pointing out both pros and cons. In such cases, the label might be NEUTRAL because it's not overwhelmingly positive or negative. The key is whether the sentiment is predominantly one way. Since they mention both good aspects (product quality, reorder) and some negatives (delivery time, dryness), but the main action (reordering) suggests overall satisfaction. However, the presence of a significant negative point (delivery time) might tip it to negative? Or maybe neutral because it's mixed.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the user is giving feedback on different aspects, and there's no clear dominance, NEUTRAL would be appropriate. The initial instruction says if it's mixed, use NEUTRAL. So I think the correct label here is NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a Turkish text that needs sentiment analysis. First, I need to understand the content. Let me break it down.\n\nThe text says: \"kokusu çok güzel maske biraz fazla yagli sampuan idare eder yaz icin ideal havuz deniz surekli dus icin kullanilabilinir\". Translating this to English might help. It mentions a product's scent is very good, the mask is a bit too oily, the shampoo is okay, it's ideal for hair, and can be used in pools, sea, and continuous washing.\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment words: \"çok güzel\" (very good) is positive. However, there are some negatives like \"biraz fazla yagli\" (a bit too oily), which might indicate a negative aspect. Then \"idare eder\" (okay) is neutral. The rest talks about usage scenarios, which are more factual.\n\nBut the overall sentiment seems mixed. However, in Turkish, sometimes even if there's a negative point, the overall tone can be positive if the positives outweigh. But here, the user mentions both positive and negative aspects. Wait, but the instruction says to label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. How do I decide?\n\nThe key is whether the dominant sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The first part is very positive (\"çok güzel\"), but then there's a negative point about being too oily. However, the rest of the text seems to be more about functionality rather than sentiment. Maybe the user is giving a mixed review but overall leaning positive because they mention it's ideal for certain uses. But I need to check if the negatives are significant enough to tip it to negative.\n\nAlternatively, since there's both positive and negative elements, maybe it's neutral. However, in some cases, even with a negative point, if the majority is positive, it might still be positive. But here, the presence of \"biraz fazla yagli\" could be a drawback. However, the user also says \"idare eder\" which is neutral. The rest is more about usage, not sentiment.\n\nHmm, maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because there are both positive and negative aspects without a clear dominance. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the main point is that the product has some issues but still has good qualities, it might be neutral. Let me check the example given in the instructions. For instance, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. So when there's a mix of positive and negative elements without clear dominance, it's neutral.\n\nIn this case, the user mentions both positive (\"çok güzel\") and negative (\"biraz fazla yagli\"), but also some neutral points. Therefore, the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this analysis. The user provided a Turkish text that needs to be categorized as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. First, I'll read through the text carefully.\n\nThe sentence starts with a conditional statement: \"Eğer gözaltlarınızda morluklarınız fazlaysa abartıldığı gibi bir sonuç almanız mümkün değil.\" Translating that, it's saying if there are too many bruises on the eyelids, you won't get an exaggerated result. Then it continues: \"Fakat günlük kullanıma oldukça uygun ince yapılı ve çizgilere dolmuyor.\" Which means \"But it's quite suitable for daily use, has a thin design, and doesn't fill lines.\"\n\nNow, I need to determine the sentiment here. The first part is a caution about potential issues (bruises leading to exaggerated results), which might be negative. However, the second part highlights positive aspects like suitability for daily use, thin design, and not filling lines. \n\nThe key here is that despite the initial warning, the overall tone seems to be more about pointing out a limitation but then emphasizing the product's benefits. The user is probably discussing a cosmetic product, maybe something like concealer or makeup. The negative part is a caveat, but the main message is positive. \n\nIn Turkish sentiment analysis, even if there's a negative point mentioned, if the overall context is more about the positives, it might lean towards POSITIVE. However, sometimes if there's a balance between pros and cons, NEUTRAL could be considered. But in this case, the negatives are presented as a condition (if you have too many bruises), which isn't necessarily a common issue for most users. The main features highlighted are positive. \n\nSo I think the label here should be POSITIVE because the overall sentiment is favorable towards the product despite mentioning a potential downside under specific circumstances.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this user review analysis. The user provided a Turkish text, and I need to determine the sentiment label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The user starts by saying they didn't have much opportunity to use the product (\"Kullanmaya çok fırsatım olmadı\"). Then they mention trying it once but couldn't fully understand the method, leading to blood collecting near their nose (\"bir denedim ama yöntemini tam bilmediğimden kan toplandı burnumun kenarına\"). They then say it's a product they've wanted for a long time (\"Çoktandır istediğim bir üründü\") and comment on the fast shipping and good packaging (\"Kargo hızlı paketleme iyi\").\n\nNow, breaking down the sentiment. The negative part is about the experience of using the product leading to an unintended consequence (blood near the nose), which is clearly a negative point. However, they also mention wanting the product for a long time, which is positive. The shipping and packaging are praised positively. But the main issue here is the negative experience with the product's usage. Even though there are positive elements, the negative experience might outweigh them. However, the user didn't explicitly say they're dissatisfied with the product itself, just that using it caused an issue. Also, they mention wanting it for a long time, which could indicate overall satisfaction despite the problem. But since the main function of the product led to a negative outcome, that's a strong negative point. However, maybe the user is neutral because they didn't explicitly say the product is bad, just that there was an issue. Wait, but the fact that using it caused blood is a significant negative aspect. On the other hand, the positive aspects are about wanting it and the shipping. It's a bit mixed. But in sentiment analysis, we usually look for the dominant emotion. The negative experience with the product's use might be more impactful than the positive aspects of wanting it and good shipping. However, the user didn't express clear dissatisfaction with the product itself beyond the usage issue. Maybe NEUTRAL because there are both positive and negative elements without a clear overall sentiment? But I need to check if the negative part is strong enough to label as NEGATIVE. Alternatively, since they mentioned wanting it for a long time and good shipping, maybe it's more neutral. Hmm. The key point here is that the user had a negative experience with using the product (blood), but also positive aspects about the product being desired and good logistics. However, the main function of the product caused a problem, which might lean towards NEGATIVE. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe NEUTRAL because it's mixed. Wait, in some cases, if there are both positive and negative elements without clear dominance, it's neutral. But sometimes the presence of a significant negative event can make it negative even with positives. This is tricky. Let me think again. The user tried the product once but couldn't use it properly, leading to an issue. However, they wanted it for a long time and liked the shipping. It's possible that the overall sentiment isn't strongly positive or negative, hence NEUTRAL. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, since the main problem was with the product's usage, which is a critical aspect, maybe NEGATIVE. However, the user didn't explicitly say they're unhappy with the product; they just described an incident. So perhaps it's more neutral because there's no clear overall sentiment expressed beyond mixed points.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Then \"verdiğim paraya üzüldüm\" translates to \"upset about the money I spent,\" clearly expressing dissatisfaction. The last part \"kullanacağımı zannetmiyorum\" is \"I don't think I'll use it,\" indicating that the user doesn't find value in the product despite the discount.\n\nThe sentiment here is negative because the user is expressing regret over the purchase and not intending to use the product.

The user wrote, \"Yüzü yakıyor idare eder fena değil.\" Translating that to English, it's something like \"It burns the face, but it's manageable, not too bad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment here. The phrase \"yüzü yakıyor\" suggests a negative experience, maybe referring to a product causing irritation or discomfort. However, the user follows up with \"idare eder fena değil,\" which translates to \"it's manageable, not too bad.\" This part is more neutral or even slightly positive because they're saying it's tolerable.\n\nSo there's a mix of negative and neutral elements. The initial complaint about the product burning the face is negative, but the overall assessment is that it's acceptable. In such cases, where there's both a negative aspect and a mitigating factor, the sentiment might lean towards neutral. The user isn't overly satisfied, nor are they extremely dissatisfied. They're acknowledging the issue but finding it manageable.\n\nI should check if there's any strong positive or negative language that could tip the scale. Words like \"fena değil\" (not bad) are neutral, while \"yakıyor\" (burning) is negative. Since the overall tone isn't strongly positive or negative, the best label here would be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a Turkish text that needs sentiment analysis. The text is: \"Saçım siyah bu renk olmadı ama kahve tonu oldu beyazları kapattı ama çabuk aktı.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context and the emotions expressed here. The person is talking about their hair color. They mention that the desired black color didn't work out (\"siyah bu renk olmadı\"), but it turned into a coffee tone (\"kahve tonu oldu\"). Then they say it covered the whites (\"beyazları kapattı\"), which might be positive, but then \"ama çabuk aktı\" – \"but it faded quickly.\" \n\nThe key here is the contrast between the initial disappointment (didn't get the desired color) and the subsequent points. The covering of white hair could be a positive aspect, but the fading quickly is negative. However, in Turkish, sometimes the structure can be tricky. Let me break down each part.\n\n\"Saçım siyah bu renk olmadı\" – negative because the expected result wasn't achieved.\n\"ama kahve tonu oldu\" – maybe neutral or slightly positive? It's a different color, but not the desired one.\n\"beyazları kapattı\" – positive, as covering white hair is often seen as beneficial.\n\"ama çabuk aktı\" – negative again, indicating the color didn't last.\n\nThe user might be expressing mixed feelings. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a mix, but one part dominates, we have to decide. The initial disappointment and the quick fading are negatives. The covering of white hair is positive, but maybe not enough to outweigh the negatives. Alternatively, since there's both positive and negative aspects, it might be neutral.\n\nBut looking at examples given: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. So if the text has both positive and negative elements without a clear dominant sentiment, it's neutral. Here, the user is talking about a product (hair dye) that didn't meet expectations but had some positives. However, the final part about fading quickly might be more impactful as a negative. But maybe the overall sentiment is mixed enough to be neutral.\n\nAlternatively, if the negatives are stronger, it could be negative. The initial disappointment and the quick fading are both negatives. The covering of white hair is positive but perhaps not as strong. So maybe the overall sentiment is negative. However, in Turkish, sometimes the structure with \"ama\" (but) can indicate a contrast that might lead to a more neutral stance.\n\nWait, the example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is a balanced view. In this case, the user has both positive and negative points but no clear overall sentiment. So maybe it's neutral. But I need to be careful here. The fact that they mention the color didn't work out and faded quickly might lean more towards negative. However, the covering of white hair could be a positive aspect. It's a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, considering the structure: the user starts with a negative point (didn't get the desired color), then mentions an alternative color which is not ideal but covers white hair (positive), and ends with another negative (faded quickly). The negatives are at the beginning and end, while the positive is in the middle. This might indicate that the overall sentiment is more negative because the initial and final points are negative.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. In some cases, people might consider the covering of white hair as a significant positive, making it neutral. However, since the product didn't meet expectations (didn't get the desired color) and faded quickly, which are both negatives, maybe the overall sentiment is negative. But again, the presence of a positive aspect complicates things.\n\nIn the absence of clear dominance, perhaps the safest label here is NEUTRAL because there are both positive and negative elements without one clearly overpowering the other.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

First, I need to understand what \"uygun fiyatlı\" means in Turkish. \"Uygun\" translates to suitable or appropriate, and \"fiyatlı\" means priced or cost. So together, it's something like \"suitably priced\" or \"reasonably priced.\" \n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The term \"uygun fiyatlı\" is generally positive because it suggests that the price is fair or reasonable. People usually use this phrase when they think the product or service is priced well for what it offers. There's no negative connotation here. It's not neutral either because it's expressing a positive judgment about the pricing.\n\nWait, but could there be any context where it's neutral? Maybe if someone is just stating a fact without opinion, but in most cases, when someone says \"uygun fiyatlı,\" they're implying satisfaction with the price.

The key words are \"rahatlattığını\" which means \"relieved\" or \"soothing,\" and \"nemlendirici mim etkisini arttırdığını\" which translates to \"increased the moisturizing effect.\" The user is talking about a product, probably skincare, since it mentions moisturizing. \n\nThe words used are positive: \"rahatlattığını\" suggests comfort, which is a good feeling. \"Arttırdığını\" indicates an enhancement, which is also positive. The overall sentiment here seems to be positive because the user is expressing satisfaction with the product's effects. There's no negative language or complaints. Even though there's a mention of \"mim etkisini,\" which might be a typo for \"mimik\" (expression) or another term, but in context, it's about moisturizing, so still positive.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden negatives, but the sentence is straightforward.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user wrote: \"güzel paketleme, iyi kalite ancak fiyat daha uygun olabilirdi.\" Translating that to English, it's something like \"nice packaging, good quality but the price could be more affordable.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The positive aspects are the packaging and quality, which are both good points. However, the user mentions that the price could be more reasonable. So there's a negative aspect regarding the price.\n\nBut how do these elements balance out? The user is pointing out positives but also a negative. In such cases, if the negatives are significant enough to outweigh the positives, it might lean towards negative. But here, the criticism is about the price being too high, not a major flaw in the product itself. \n\nThe key words here are \"güzel\" (nice) and \"iyi kalite\" (good quality), which are positive. The negative part is \"fiyat daha uygun olabilirdi\" (the price could be more affordable). However, the user isn't saying the price is bad, just that it's not as good as it could be. \n\nIn sentiment analysis, when there's a mix of positive and negative but no strong negative emotions, sometimes it's neutral. But in this case, the user is expressing satisfaction with some aspects but a desire for improvement in another. However, since the main product aspects (quality) are positive, and the price is just a suggestion for improvement, maybe it's still positive overall.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. If there's a mix, how do we decide? The example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which translates to \"Okay considering the price,\" implying that the user is neutral because they accept the price as fair. In this case, the user is saying the quality is good but the price could be better. That might lean more towards negative if the price is a significant factor. However, since the user still acknowledges the positive aspects and only mentions the price as a possible improvement, maybe it's neutral.\n\nAlternatively, if the main sentiment is positive with a minor negative, it might still be positive. But I think in this case, because the user is pointing out that the price isn't optimal, even though other factors are good, the overall sentiment could be seen as mixed but leaning towards positive. However, according to standard sentiment analysis practices, if there's a clear negative aspect mentioned alongside positives, it might be considered neutral or even negative depending on context.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. Here, the user isn't saying the price is bad, just that it could be better. So maybe this is similar to the example where the sentiment is neutral because the user is not overly satisfied but not entirely dissatisfied either. The presence of both positive and negative elements without a clear dominant emotion might lead to neutral.\n\nBut I need to check if the system's rules consider such cases as neutral. Since the user has both positive and negative points, but no strong negative emotions, maybe it's neutral. Alternatively, if the positive aspects are more significant, it could be positive. However, in this case, the price is a key factor for many users, so pointing out that it's not optimal might tip the balance towards negative.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me think again. The user says \"güzel paketleme\" and \"iyi kalite,\" which are strong positives. Then they mention the price could be better. But since they didn't use strong negative words like \"çok pahalı\" (very expensive) or \"kötü fiyat\" (bad price), it's more of a mild criticism. In such cases, the sentiment might still be positive because the main aspects are good, and the price is just a suggestion for improvement.\n\nAlternatively, if the user had said \"iyi kalite ama çok pahalı,\" that would be more negative. But here, it's \"fiyat daha uygun olabilirdi\" which is a softer criticism. So maybe the overall sentiment is still positive with a minor negative note, but according to the rules, if there's a mix, how do we decide?\n\nLooking at the examples again: The first example was clearly positive (\"harikaydı\"), the second clearly negative (\"zehirlendim\"). The third example was neutral because it's an acceptance of the price. In this case, the user is not accepting the price but suggesting it could be better. However, since they still mention positive aspects, maybe it's a mix. But according to standard sentiment analysis, if there are both positive and negative elements without clear dominance, it might be neutral.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: The presence of \"ancak\" (but) introduces the negative part. In Turkish, using \"ancak\" can indicate that the following statement is a contrast or a drawback. However, if the overall sentiment is still positive despite the drawback, maybe it's positive. But in some cases, such contrasts can lead to neutral.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is pointing out a specific area for improvement but not expressing strong dissatisfaction, it might be considered as a mix of positive and negative, leading to neutral. However, I need to follow the examples given. The example where the sentiment was neutral was about accepting the price. Here, the user isn't accepting the price but suggesting it could be better. So maybe that's different.\n\nWait, in the third example: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is \"Okay considering the price,\" so the user is satisfied with the product given the price. That's neutral because they're not complaining about the price but acknowledging it as acceptable. In our case, the user is saying that the quality is good but the price could be more affordable. So they are not accepting the current price but suggesting a change. This might lean towards negative if the price is a significant factor, but since the other aspects are positive, maybe it's still positive.\n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Given that there are both positive and negative elements, but no strong negative emotions, and the user is not entirely dissatisfied, the label might be neutral. However, if the system considers any mention of price as a significant factor leading to negative sentiment, it could be negative. But based on the examples provided, where \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral, I think in this case, since the user is not entirely satisfied with the price but still acknowledges the positives, it's more likely to be neutral.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

Then the last sentence: \"Aldıktan bir gün sonra yarım fiyatına düşmesi çok sinir bozucu\" translates to \"The fact that it drops to half price after a day is really annoying.\" Definitely negative.\n\nSo there's a mix of positive and negative points. But the overall sentiment seems more negative because the user had trouble using the product, found it unsuitable for some people, and was annoyed by the price drop.

First, I need to understand the content.\n\nThe text says: \"rengi göründüğünden çok daha açık beyaz tenlilere olabilir ama esmerlere olmuyor bence,kalıcılığı asla cikmiyor evet kalıcı bayağı.\" Translating that, it's talking about a product's color. The user mentions that the color is much lighter than it appears, which might be suitable for fair-skinned people but not for darker skin tones. Then there's a part about durability: \"kalıcılığı asla cikmiyor evet kalıcı bayağı.\" That translates to something like \"the durability never comes out, yes it's very durable.\" Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe they meant the color doesn't fade at all, which is good, but the product isn't suitable for darker skin tones.\n\nNow, analyzing sentiment. The first part has a negative note about suitability for certain skin tones. But then there's a positive comment on durability. However, the overall tone might be neutral because the user is pointing out both pros and cons without strong emotional language. Words like \"bence\" (in my opinion) indicate personal perspective. The mixed feedback—some positive, some negative—might lead to a neutral label. But I need to check if there's a stronger sentiment. The part about durability being very good (\"kalıcı bayağı\") is positive, but the suitability issue is a con.

The key here is to determine if the statement expresses a positive feeling, negative, or neutral. Since the user is talking about a price being very reasonable, that's generally a positive remark. People usually express satisfaction when they find something affordable or good value for money.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there's any context where \"uygun fiyat\" could be negative. Maybe in some cases, but typically, it's positive. The word \"çok\" intensifies the positivity. So the sentiment here is definitely positive. No ambiguity here. The user is happy with the price.

The text is: \"korumasi filan iyi güzel de bu gunes kremlerinin neden light olani bile koyulasiyor yuzde.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. Translating it to English might help. It seems like the user is talking about sunscreen (gunes kremleri) and mentions \"light\" versions. The words \"iyi güzel\" are positive, but then there's a question about why the light ones are being used on the face (\"yuzde\"). \n\nWait, maybe they're confused about why the lighter sunscreens are applied to the face. The structure is a bit unclear. There's a mix of positive terms and a question that might indicate confusion or dissatisfaction. However, there's no explicit negative word here. The user isn't complaining but rather asking a question.\n\nIn Turkish sentiment analysis, words like \"iyi güzel\" are definitely positive. But the rest of the sentence is more about inquiry than expressing a negative feeling. Since there's no clear negative language, even though it's a question, the overall sentiment might still be neutral because they're not expressing dissatisfaction but rather seeking information.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in Turkish, when someone asks why something is happening, especially if they expect a certain outcome and it's not met, it could imply frustration. However, without explicit negative words like \"kötü\" or \"memnun değilim,\" it's safer to lean towards neutral here. The user isn't clearly happy or unhappy; they're just questioning the use of light sunscreens on the face.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user wrote, \"Kokusu gayet güzel. sadece kalıcılığı biraz az.\" Translating that to English, it's something like, \"The smell is very nice.

The first part is clearly positive: \"gayet güzel\" means \"very beautiful/good,\" which is a strong positive adjective. The second part starts with \"sadece\" which translates to \"only\" or \"just,\" indicating a minor issue. Then \"kalıcılığı biraz az\" means \"the longevity is a bit low.\" So the user is pointing out a negative aspect, but it's tempered by the use of \"biraz\" (a bit), suggesting it's not a major problem.\n\nNow, according to the rules, I need to categorize this into POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The presence of both positive and negative elements complicates things. However, the overall sentiment seems more positive because the main compliment is about the smell being very good, and the negative part is a minor critique. In such cases where there's a mix but the positive outweighs the negative, the label should be POSITIVE. If the negative part was stronger or more significant, it might tip to NEGATIVE, but here it's just a small drawback. NEUTRAL would be if there were no clear positive or negative leanings, but that's not the case here. So the correct label is POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The use of negative adjectives like \"saçma sapan\" strongly indicates a negative sentiment.

The phrase is clearly positive because \"güzel\" is a positive adjective, and \"gayet\" intensifies it. There's no negative language here.

However, in context, when combined with \"pigmentasyonu kötü\" (which means \"bad pigmentation\"), it might be referring to a product or something related to skin condition. \n\nThe user is likely talking about a skincare product or treatment. If the product is small and has bad pigmentation, that's probably a negative review. The conjunction \"hem... hem...\" (both... and...) is used here, which in Turkish can emphasize two negative aspects.

Maybe they're implying that the product is as harmful or irritating as nylon, which is a synthetic material known for causing allergies in some people.\n\nSo the sentiment here is negative because the user is talking about a negative experience (allergic reaction).

If someone says something is good compared to before, does that always mean positive? Yes, because they're expressing a favorable opinion about the current situation relative to the past. Even if the first use wasn't great, the fact that it's better now would still be a positive statement.\n\nAre there any negative words here? No. \"Güzel\" is clearly positive. The structure of the sentence doesn't indicate any sarcasm or hidden meaning. So the sentiment should be positive.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The key part is \"hiç beğenmedim,\" which translates to \"I didn't like it at all.\" That's a strong negative statement. Even though there's a mention of a change in color, the overall sentiment is clearly negative because the user expresses dissatisfaction.\n\nLooking at the rules again: I need to make sure I only output JSON with the label. No markdown, just the JSON. The example given for negative was \"Zehirlendim.\" which is straightforward. Here, even though there's a neutral part about the color changing, the strong negative verb \"beğenmedim\" tips it towards NEGATIVE.\n\nI should check if there's any ambiguity.

In Turkish, when someone says something isn't worth the price, it's a common way to express negative sentiment about value for money. I should check if there are any other nuances, but the straightforward translation and usage here point towards a negative label.

The words used are \"muhteşem\" which means excellent or amazing, \"çok doğal\" meaning very natural, \"sürümü çok rahat\" which translates to the application is very comfortable, and \"dudağı kurutmuyor\" meaning it doesn't dry out the lips.\n\nAll these adjectives are positive. Words like \"muhteşem\" and \"doğal\" are strong positives. The user is talking about a product, possibly lipstick or a similar item, and they're highlighting its good qualities: color, naturalness, comfort, and not drying the lips. There's no negative language here. Even the structure of the sentences is positive, with no complaints or criticisms.\n\nSo, the sentiment should be POSITIVE.

The user starts with \"bence\" which means \"in my opinion,\" so that's a personal statement.

Next, \"masaj yapıyor yüzüne\" means \"it does a massage on the face,\" which is a feature of the product. Finally, \"Kan dolaşımını hızlandırıyor\" means \"speeds up blood circulation,\" which is a benefit mentioned.\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"çok güzel\" is strongly positive.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, looking at the words used. \"İndirimli\" means discounted or on sale, which is usually a positive thing because people like getting things cheaper. The verb \"alın\" is \"buy\" in Turkish, so the sentence is suggesting buying something at a discount. The emoji 👌🏻 is a checkmark, which often signifies approval or agreement. \n\nPutting that together, the message seems to be encouraging someone to buy something because it's discounted. That would typically be a positive sentiment. However, I should check if there's any context where this might be negative. For example, sometimes discounts can be seen as a sign of lower quality, but in most cases, especially in marketing, discounts are positive.

The first part clearly expresses a strong negative sentiment about the fabric. The second part mentions returning the item, which is a consequence of the dissatisfaction.

The user starts by saying the closure (kapatıcılık) is good, which is positive. However, they mention that the structure (yapısı) is too heavy, leading them to use it very rarely. The key words here are \"fazla ağır\" (too heavy) and \"çok çok nadir kullanıyorum\" (use it very rarely).

So, the person is expressing dissatisfaction because the S size didn't meet their expectations, maybe it was too small or not fitting well.\n\nNow, I need to determine the sentiment here. The key words are \"memnun kalmadım,\" which means \"wasn't satisfied.\" That's a clear indicator of negative sentiment.

The key here is whether the phrase conveys a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. \"Orta düzeyde\" is a neutral description. It doesn't have any inherently positive or negative words.

The sentence has both positive and negative elements. However, in such cases where there's a mix, the general rule is to look at the overall context.

The key words are \"çok küçük\" (too small) and \"beklemiyordum\" (wasn't expecting). The user is expressing disappointment because the product or item received was smaller than anticipated.

Similarly, here the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the size received, which is a negative experience.\n\nI should check if there's any positive or neutral nuance I'm missing. The phrase \"açıkcası\" (honestly) might just be emphasizing the sentiment but doesn't change the overall tone. There's no indication of satisfaction or neutrality here. The user clearly expected something larger and was disappointed, so NEGATIVE is the appropriate label.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

They mention that the pens were nice and had different colors, but some of them ran out after very little use. Then there's a part about not paying attention to that and whether to buy or not.\n\nFirst, I should identify the sentiment here. The positive aspects are the pens being nice and having different colors. However, the negative part is that some pens didn't last long. The user is warning others to be careful when buying. \n\nNow, the challenge is determining if the overall sentiment is more positive, negative, or neutral. The review starts with a positive note but then points out a significant flaw. The mention of the pens running out quickly seems like a strong negative point. However, the user also provides a warning, which might be seen as a neutral advice. \n\nBut in sentiment analysis, even if there's a mix, we have to look at the dominant emotion. The fact that the product didn't last long is a major negative aspect. Even though they liked the appearance, the functionality issue (pens running out) is a critical point against the product. So the overall sentiment here is likely negative. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. The user might be trying to balance both sides, but in terms of the product's quality and performance, the negative aspect outweighs the positive. Therefore, labeling this as NEGATIVE makes sense.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The example given for negative is \"Zehirlendim.\" which means \"I got poisoned,\" so clearly a negative sentiment. Similarly, \"beğenmedim\" is expressing dislike, which should be NEGATIVE.\n\nWait, but sometimes people might use sarcasm or context could change the meaning. However, in this case, there's no indication of sarcasm. The word is direct and clear. So the label should definitely be NEGATIVE. No need to consider NEUTRAL here because it's a strong expression of dislike. POSITIVE is out of the question.

The user wrote, \"Fena değil sivilcelerim gitmedi.\" Translating that to English, it's something like, \"Not bad, my acne didn't go away.\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment here. The phrase \"Fena değil\" translates to \"Not bad,\" which is generally a positive or neutral statement. However, the second part, \"sivilcelerim gitmedi,\" means \"my acne didn't go away.\" That's negative because the person is expressing that their acne hasn't improved.\n\nSo there's a mix here. The first part is neutral or slightly positive, but the second part is clearly negative. In sentiment analysis, when there's a contradiction or mixed emotions, it can be tricky. But usually, the overall sentiment would lean towards negative if the main point is about something not improving. However, \"Fena değil\" might indicate that they're not overly upset, just stating a fact.\n\nWait, but in Turkish, \"Fena değil\" can sometimes be used to downplay a negative situation. Like, \"It's not too bad,\" but still acknowledging there's an issue. So the person is saying their acne didn't go away, which is a problem, but they're not using strong negative language. \n\nConsidering the rules, I need to pick between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since the main content is about acne not improving, which is a negative outcome, even though \"Fena değil\" might soften it, the overall sentiment is more negative. However, some might argue it's neutral because they're just stating a fact without strong emotions. But in context, the user is likely expressing dissatisfaction with the treatment of their acne, so NEGATIVE makes sense here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

However, the key part here is \"Ürün mükemmel\" which directly translates to \"The product is perfect.\" That's a strong positive statement.\n\nEven though there's a part that's a bit ambiguous (\"Tek kelime alın\"), the overall sentiment is clearly positive because of the explicit praise for the product.

Then \"asla\" means \"never\" or \"absolutely not,\" emphasizing the negativity. The phrase \"tavsiye etmiyorum\" translates to \"I don't recommend,\" which is a strong negative statement.\n\nThe user is clearly expressing dissatisfaction with the delivery service.

The user wrote, \"Açıkçası ben kullandım ama oyle çokta bir faydasını görmedim.\" Translating that to English: \"Frankly, I used it but I didn't see much benefit.\" \n\nFirst, the person admits they used the product or service (\"ben kullandım\"). Then they say they didn't see much benefit (\"çokta bir faydasını görmedim\"). The key here is the use of \"ama\" (but), which introduces a contrast. They used it but didn't find significant benefits.\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment. The user isn't outright negative; they're stating a fact that they didn't see much benefit. However, the absence of positive effects could lean towards negative. But wait, in some contexts, if someone says they didn't see benefits, it might be neutral because they're just reporting their experience without strong negative emotions. \n\nBut considering the structure: \"Açıkçası\" (frankly) sets a tone of honesty. The use of \"ama\" suggests that despite using it, there was no significant benefit. This could imply dissatisfaction, which is more negative. However, if they didn't have any negative experience either, maybe neutral. But the lack of benefit might be seen as a negative outcome.\n\nWait, but in some cases, people might not find benefits but also not have negative experiences. For example, if a product works as expected but doesn't exceed expectations. In that case, it's neutral. However, here the user is saying they didn't see much benefit, which could be interpreted as the product not meeting their expectations, leading to a negative sentiment.\n\nBut I need to check the examples given. The example for NEUTRAL was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (Okay considering the price.) That's neutral because it's a balanced view. In this case, the user is saying they didn't see much benefit, which might be more negative than neutral. However, if there's no explicit negative language, maybe it's still neutral.\n\nHmm. The key is whether the sentiment is clearly positive, negative, or neutral. Since the user is stating a lack of benefit but not expressing dissatisfaction beyond that, it might be neutral. But in some contexts, not seeing benefits could be seen as negative. However, without explicit negative words like \"kötü\" (bad) or \"memnun değilim\" (not satisfied), maybe it's safer to go with NEUTRAL.\n\nWait, the example given for NEGATIVE was \"Zehirlendim.\" (I got poisoned.) That's clearly negative. The user here didn't have a bad experience but just didn't find benefits. So perhaps NEUTRAL is more appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user wants a sentiment analysis in JSON format with labels POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the Turkish sentence. \"Idare edicek\" translates to something like \"manageable\" or \"can be handled\". \"Bir kokusu var\" means \"has a smell\" or \"has an odor\". So the whole phrase is saying that the item has a manageable smell. \n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The word \"idare edicek\" is neutral in itself; it's more of a descriptive term. The context here is about a smell. If someone says something has a manageable smell, they might be implying that the smell isn't too bad, but not necessarily positive. However, in Turkish, sometimes phrases like this can be slightly negative if the smell is unpleasant but tolerable. Alternatively, it could be neutral because it's just stating a fact without strong positive or negative connotations.\n\nBut wait, \"idare edicek\" might have a slight negative undertone here. If something has a smell that needs to be managed, it might be considered bad. However, the user might be using it in a neutral way, just describing the presence of a smell without judgment. \n\nLooking at examples provided: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled NEUTRAL. That's similar because it's a neutral statement about price. So here, \"idare edicek bir kokusu var\" is stating that there's a smell that can be managed, which is more of a neutral observation rather than positive or negative.

Maybe they meant \"5 yıldız\" (5 stars)? But even if it's \"5yıldoz,\" the context suggests they're confused about why someone would give 5 stars to something that smells so bad. That part seems negative.\n\nThen, \"Kokudan eline alamadım boyaları.\" So they couldn't take the paints because of the smell.

No.\" That's a clear negative statement. The user is expressing dissatisfaction by saying they wouldn't repurchase the product.\n\nPutting it all together, even though there's an initial mention of average, the overall sentiment leans towards negative because of the explicit refusal to repurchase and the hesitation in praising it.

So the overall sentiment here is more negative because the consequence (acne) is a strong negative factor that affects the user's experience negatively.\n\nAlternatively, if the positive and negative are balanced, it could be neutral. But in this case, the negative effect is personal and direct, which might make the sentiment lean towards negative.

Since \"bayıldım\" is clearly a positive sentiment, and there's no indication of negativity or neutrality here, the label should be POSITIVE. \n\nI should also check if there are any sarcasm or hidden meanings, but in this case, it seems straightforward. The user is expressing a strong positive reaction. So the correct JSON output would be {\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Words like \"harika\" (great) or \"tavsiye ediyorum\" (I recommend) are positive indicators. However, in this case, the user says \"özellikle kış aylarında kuruluklara karşı çok iyi bittikçe aldığım bir ürün\" which translates to \"especially during winter months, it's very good for dryness as I bought it gradually.\" The phrase \"bittikçe aldığım\" might be a bit confusing. Wait, maybe it's \"bitimce\" (after finishing) but the user wrote \"bittikçe,\" which is \"as it progresses.\" Hmm, maybe they mean they bought it gradually over time. But regardless, the main points are that the product works well for dryness in winter and the delivery was fast.\n\nThe key positive words here are \"çok iyi\" (very good) and \"hızlı teslimat\" (fast delivery), along with \"tavsiye ediyorum\" (I recommend). There's no negative language. Even though there's a bit of confusion in the sentence structure, the overall sentiment is positive.

The sentence is clearly expressing dissatisfaction with the quality of something. Words like \"değildi\" (was not) indicate a negative judgment. There's no ambiguity here; the user is pointing out that the product or service did not meet their expectations in terms of quality.\n\nLooking at the rules again: the output must be JSON with the label as either POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this user review analysis. The user provided a Turkish text, and I need to determine the sentiment label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The user mentions that the product arrived as expected but notes that there was no security band indicating it hadn't been used before. Then they say the smell is good, and the product leaves a pleasant feeling, but after that, they definitely need a moisturizer.\n\nBreaking this down, the initial part about the product arriving correctly and the good smell are positive points. However, the absence of a security band might be a negative point because it could imply potential issues with the product's condition. The mention of needing a moisturizer afterward is another negative aspect, suggesting that the product isn't sufficient on its own.\n\nBut wait, the user also says \"yüzde bıraktığı his iyi\" which translates to \"the feeling it leaves is good,\" so there's a positive note there. However, the necessity for a moisturizer after might be seen as a drawback. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning towards negative because the main product (moisturizer) is needed after using this item, which could indicate that the product isn't effective on its own. \n\nHowever, I need to check if the negatives outweigh the positives. The security band absence is a concern, and needing another product afterward is a downside. But the good smell and initial feeling are positive. However, in sentiment analysis, even if there are some positives, if the overall experience has more negatives or critical issues, it might be labeled as negative. Alternatively, if the positives and negatives balance out, it could be neutral.\n\nBut looking at the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is NEUTRAL. So in this case, the user's review has both positive and negative aspects but doesn't strongly lean either way. However, the need for a moisturizer after might be a significant negative point. But maybe the overall sentiment isn't strongly negative because there are positives mentioned.\n\nWait, but the example where \"Yemek harikaydı.\" is POSITIVE, so if the majority of the review is positive, it's labeled as such. Here, the user mentions both good and bad points. However, in Turkish reviews, sometimes the presence of a complaint (like no security band) might be considered negative even if there are positives. But the fact that they needed a moisturizer after could be a strong negative point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's neutral because there are both positive and negative aspects without a clear majority. The user is pointing out some issues but also acknowledging good points. However, in sentiment analysis, sometimes the presence of any negative aspect can tip the scale unless the positives are overwhelmingly stronger.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. The user says the product arrived as expected (positive), smell is good (positive), feeling is good (positive). But no security band (negative) and needs a moisturizer after (negative). So two negatives and three positives? Or maybe the negatives are more impactful. However, in terms of sentiment analysis, it's about the overall tone. If the user ends with needing another product, that might be a stronger negative. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since there are both positive and negative points without clear dominance, it could be neutral. The example given by the user for NEUTRAL was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is a balanced statement. So in this case, maybe the sentiment is NEUTRAL because the review has mixed elements.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

However, they also say \"onun dışında hiç bir şey olmadı\" meaning nothing else happened. \n\nNow, considering the sentiment labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL.

Even though there's a neutral part about nothing else happening, the overall sentiment is dominated by the negative aspects.\n\nI should check if there's any ambiguity.

The user is justifying their decision based on the price being right. That suggests a positive sentiment towards the price, even though they might have made an error in purchasing. However, there's no explicit negative language about the product itself. They didn't mention dissatisfaction with the product quality or service. \n\nThe phrase \"iade etmeyeceğim\" (I won't return it) could be seen as a negative action, but the reason given is positive (\"uygun fiyatlı\"). So overall, the sentiment seems to lean towards neutral because the user isn't expressing strong negative emotions about the product itself, just making a decision based on price. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's an underlying frustration from not reading the details, but the text doesn't express that explicitly. The main point is the justification for keeping the item due to the price. So I think NEUTRAL is the right label here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The negatives are the skin type issues, limited effectiveness noticed, and variability in results. But the user isn't outrightly complaining; they're stating their experience without strong negative language. The overall sentiment seems mixed but leaning towards neutral because they mention both pros and cons without a clear positive or negative bias.

The user is clearly expressing a negative opinion about the action mentioned, even though there's a mention of an exception (cutting sweat), they still advise against it. \n\nSo, the sentiment here is definitely negative.

Now, depending on context, \"küçük\" could be neutral, but in this case, since it's paired with \"çok kötü\", it might be emphasizing that the fabric is not only bad but also small, which could be a negative point. However, sometimes \"küçük\" can be positive if someone prefers smaller sizes, but here without more context, the main sentiment comes from \"çok kötü\". The user is likely expressing dissatisfaction with the product's material and size. So combining both parts, the overall sentiment is negative.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

It seems like the user is talking about a product they used, maybe makeup since there's \"pudralı\" (powder). The phrases \"bir daha asla almam\" mean \"I will never buy again,\" which is strongly negative. Then \"zor cıkartırdım\" translates to \"it was hard to remove,\" and \"derimi çekti resmen\" could be \"it pulled my skin, literally.\" These are all negative experiences.\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"asla almam\" (never buy again), \"zor\" (hard), \"çekti\" (pulled). All these indicate dissatisfaction. The user is expressing a very negative experience with the product, probably makeup that caused irritation or was difficult to remove. \n\nThe rules say to use only POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze the user's comment: \"Yüzüme resmen renk geldi.\" The key here is understanding the context and the connotations of the words used. The phrase \"renk geldi\" translates to \"got color\" or \"looked colorful.\" In Turkish, when someone says that about a person's face, it can have different meanings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if this is a positive statement. If the person is talking about looking healthy or vibrant, then it's positive. However, there's also a possibility of sarcasm or negative connotations. For example, in some contexts, \"renk gelmek\" might imply that someone looks unwell or has a flushed face due to illness, which would be negative.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided any additional context. The original instruction says to analyze based solely on the given text. Without more information, I should default to the most common interpretation. In many cases, \"renk geldi\" when referring to someone's face is a positive remark about their appearance, suggesting they look good or healthy. \n\nHowever, there's also a possibility of it being neutral if the statement is just stating a fact without any emotional charge. But considering the examples given in the instructions, where similar phrases were labeled as positive or negative based on clear indicators, I need to check for any explicit negative words here.\n\nThe word \"resmen\" means \"literally\" or \"actually,\" which might emphasize the statement but doesn't inherently make it positive or negative. The main phrase is \"renk geldi.\" If there's no clear negative term, and considering that looking colorful can be a compliment, I would lean towards positive. However, if the context was about illness, it could be negative. But without that context, the safest bet based on common usage is positive.\n\nWait, but in some cases, \"renk gelmek\" might be used sarcastically to imply someone looks unwell. For example, if someone has a fever, their face might look flushed, and saying \"renk geldi\" could be a way of indicating that. But again, without context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThe user provided examples where \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. So, if the statement is just stating a fact without clear positive or negative sentiment, it might be neutral. However, in this case, \"renk geldi\" could be seen as a compliment, making it positive. But I need to make sure there's no hidden sarcasm.\n\nSince the user hasn't indicated any sarcasm markers like quotation marks or obvious irony, and given that the instruction is to analyze based solely on the text, I should go with the most straightforward interpretation. Therefore, labeling it as POSITIVE might be appropriate here.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The user wrote, \"Umarım dökülen saçlarıma iyi gelir yorumlara bakarak aldım.\" Translating that to English: \"I hope it will be good for my falling hair; I bought it based on reviews.\"\n\nFirst, the main sentiment here seems to be a mix of hope and reliance on others' experiences. The phrase \"Umarım\" translates to \"I hope,\" which is positive but also shows uncertainty. The second part mentions buying based on reviews, which indicates the user is cautious or seeking reassurance.\n\nNow, looking at the keywords: \"dökülen saçlarıma iyi gelir\" (good for my falling hair) – this is a positive outcome they're hoping for. However, the use of \"umarım\" suggests that the outcome isn't certain yet. The act of buying based on reviews might indicate some skepticism or neutral stance because they're relying on others' experiences rather than personal certainty.\n\nBut wait, the overall sentiment here is more about hope and cautious optimism. Even though there's uncertainty, the primary emotion is positive because they're taking action with the intention of a positive result. However, since the outcome isn't confirmed yet, maybe it's neutral? Hmm.\n\nWait, but in the examples given, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. That translates to \"Okay for the price,\" which is a balanced view. Similarly, here, the user is expressing hope but also relying on reviews, which might indicate a neutral stance because they're not overly positive or negative yet. The uncertainty and reliance on external factors (reviews) could tip it towards neutral rather than positive.\n\nBut another angle: the act of purchasing based on reviews shows some confidence in the product's effectiveness, hence a positive intent. However, the use of \"umarım\" introduces doubt. So maybe it's a mix but leaning towards neutral because the outcome is not yet determined. The user isn't expressing clear satisfaction or dissatisfaction; they're just hoping for a good result based on others' experiences.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

First, I need to understand the sentiment here.\n\nThe phrase \"Kuruluk yaptı\" translates to something like \"he/she did a favor\" or \"he/she helped out.\" But the word \"malesef\" means \"unfortunately\" or \"regrettably,\" which usually indicates a negative sentiment. However, in Turkish, sometimes people use \"malesef\" sarcastically or with a different nuance depending on context.\n\nThe emoji used is 😏, which is a smirking face. That could suggest sarcasm or a playful tone. So putting it all together: the person might be saying that someone did a favor, but they're expressing regret or disappointment about it, possibly in a sarcastic way. \n\nBut wait, \"kuruluk yaptı\" can also mean \"he/she made a mistake\" depending on context. However, \"kuruluk\" more commonly refers to something like a favor or assistance. So the user is saying that someone did a favor, but they're expressing regret about it. The emoji adds a layer of sarcasm or insincerity.\n\nConsidering all this, the sentiment seems negative because of \"malesef,\" even though there's a possibility of sarcasm. However, the primary emotion here is regret or disappointment, which leans towards negative. Alternatively, if the context was positive but with sarcasm, it might be neutral.

First, I need to analyze this in Turkish.\n\nThe word \"çok\" means \"very\" or \"a lot\", which is a positive intensifier. Then \"begenildi\" comes from the verb \"beğenmek\", which means \"to like\" or \"to be liked\". The suffix \"-ildi\" indicates past passive, so \"was liked\". The phrase \"çok begenildi\" translates to \"was very much liked\" or \"was greatly appreciated\".\n\nThe second part is \"buda\", which is a contraction of \"bu da\" meaning \"this also\". It's used to add emphasis or to refer back to something previously mentioned. \n\nPutting it all together, the sentence seems to be expressing that something was very well received or appreciated. The use of \"çok\" with \"begenildi\" strongly indicates a positive sentiment. Even though \"buda\" might not carry emotional weight on its own, in this context, it's reinforcing the previous statement.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but given the straightforward structure and the absence of negative words, it's safe to assume the sentiment is positive.

First, I need to analyze this in Turkish.\n\nBreaking it down: \"tamm\" might be a typo for \"tamam\", which means \"okay\" or \"all right\". Then \"iyi\" is \"good\". \"Sarartmadı\" – the root word is \"sararmak\", which can mean \"to turn yellow\" or \"to become discolored\". So \"sarartmadı\" would be \"did not turn yellow\" or \"did not discolor\".\n\nPutting it together: \"Tamam iyi sarartmadı.\" Maybe the user meant that something was supposed to be good but didn't discolor? Or perhaps they're saying that even though it's okay, it didn't change color. But the context is a bit unclear.\n\nLooking at the sentiment words: \"iyi\" is positive, but \"sarartmadı\" might be negative if they expected it to change color and it didn't. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The sentence structure is a bit confusing. Maybe there's a typo or grammatical error.\n\nConsidering the rules, I need to decide between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since \"iyi\" is positive but the rest is unclear, maybe the overall sentiment isn't strongly negative or positive. However, if the user is saying that something didn't discolor (maybe a product), and they expected it to be good, but it didn't change color, that could be neutral. Alternatively, if they're disappointed that it didn't discolor, it might be negative.

The text is in Turkish, so I need to make sure I understand the nuances correctly.\n\nFirst, the user mentions \"Kargoda bir sıkıntı yaşamadım\" which translates to not having any issues with the delivery. That's a positive point. Then they say \"bir daha asla sleepy marka ped kullanmayı düşünüyorum\" – they won't use the Sleepy brand again. That's negative. \n\nNext, they mention \"Vegan olması almamda etkili olmuştu\" – the vegan aspect influenced their purchase positively. But then they criticize the product's emiciliği (probably a typo for \"emici\" which means absorbency) as very bad and that it causes irritation. Those are strong negative points.\n\nSo there's a mix of positive (delivery, vegan aspect) and negative (product quality, irritation).

Next is \"küçük,\" which means \"small.\" Then \"kullanıssız\" – that's a bit tricky. \"Kullanışsız\" typically means \"useless\" or \"not useful,\" which is negative. \n\nPutting it all together: The user is saying something is \"incredibly small and useless.\" The combination of \"inanılmaz\" with \"küçük\" might be emphasizing how small it is, but the main negative term here is \"kullanıssız.\" Even though \"inanılmaz\" can be positive, in this context, it's paired with a negative adjective. So the overall sentiment is likely negative. \n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or idiomatic expression, but without more context, it's safe to go with the direct meaning.

The sentence has two parts connected by \"ama,\" which means \"but\" in Turkish. The first part is positive: \"Güzel sürülüyor\" (it's applied nicely). The second part is negative: \"zor çıkıyor\" (hard to get out). \n\nNow, the challenge is determining whether the overall sentiment is more positive, negative, or neutral. Since there's a contrast between the two parts, it might be neutral because the user is pointing out both a positive and a negative aspect. However, sometimes in such cases, the dominant part can influence the sentiment. But here, both aspects are equally weighted. The user isn't clearly leaning more towards one than the other. \n\nLooking at the examples provided: when there's a mix of positive and negative, like \"Fiyatına göre okey,\" which translates to \"Okay for the price,\" it's considered neutral.

The user mentions they've been using the product for years, which could indicate satisfaction or at least continued use. However, they also mention a \"hafif kokusu\" which translates to \"slight smell.\" Now, whether that's positive or negative depends on context.\n\nIn many cases, a slight smell might be seen as a negative aspect, especially if it's unexpected or unpleasant.

The user starts with \"titreşimi gayet iyi beğendim\" which translates to \"I really liked the vibration\" or \"the tremor was very good.\" That's a positive statement.\n\nThen they say \"daha bir kere kullanabıldim\" which means \"I haven't used it again yet.\" Hmm, that might be neutral or slightly negative, but in context, maybe they're just stating they haven't used it again, not necessarily complaining.\n\nThe smiley face \":)\" adds a positive emotion. Finally, \"ama çok hoşuma gitti\" translates to \"but it really pleased me.\" The word \"ama\" (but) might indicate a contrast, but the overall sentiment here is still positive because they're expressing that it was pleasing despite not using it again.\n\nSo combining all parts: positive statements with some neutral elements, but the overall sentiment leans towards positive.

Since \"güzel\" is clearly a positive adjective, this should be a positive statement. There's no ambiguity here. The user is expressing satisfaction with the scent, which is a positive feeling.\n\nI need to make sure there are no hidden negatives or sarcasm.

The main issue here is the negative experience with the product's residue leading to a return. Words like \"çok iz bırakıyordu\" (a lot of residue) are negative. Even though there's no explicit negative word, the context implies dissatisfaction. The action of returning the product also suggests a negative outcome. \n\nSo the sentiment should be NEGATIVE.

So the sentence translates to \"It seemed good\" or \"It looked good.\"\n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The word \"iyi\" is positive, but the phrase \"gibiydi\" suggests that it's a perception or an impression. The user might be expressing that something appeared good, but maybe there's some hesitation or uncertainty.

They also mention that it was a bit dry and \"boya\" which might be a typo or slang. Maybe \"boya\" here refers to something else, but in context, it could be \"boy\" (child) or another term.

Even though the initial action of buying was positive, the overall sentiment here is dominated by the negative experience with the product. The user is expressing dissatisfaction despite the initial enthusiasm. \n\nSo, even though there's a positive part at the beginning, the main sentiment is negative because the user ends up not liking the product and points out its flaws.

However, they point out a missing piece of information (storage in the fridge) that wasn't on the product's website. This could be seen as a negative point because it's an oversight. But the user doesn't express frustration or dissatisfaction; instead, they're informing others about the storage requirement. \n\nThe overall tone seems neutral. They're sharing their experience without strong positive or negative emotions. The mention of not having issues is positive, but the missing information isn't framed as a complaint.

Translating that to English, it says something like \"the product is good, really, it seems like it will show whether it works or not over time.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check the sentiment. The user starts by saying \"ürün iyi\" which means \"the product is good,\" so that's a positive statement. Then they mention \"yakıyor gibi\" which could be a bit tricky. \"Yakmak\" usually means to burn, but in context here, maybe it's slang or a typo? Wait, maybe it's \"yakıyor\" as in \"it seems like it's working\" or \"it's effective\"? Hmm, not sure. But the next part says \"işe yarayıp yaramayacağını zaman gösterecek,\" which translates to \"time will show whether it works or not.\" \n\nSo the user is expressing that the product is good but they're uncertain about its effectiveness over time. The initial statement is positive, but there's a note of uncertainty. However, in sentiment analysis, we usually look at the overall tone. Even though there's some doubt, the main sentiment here seems to be leaning towards positive because they start with \"ürün iyi\" and don't use strong negative words. The uncertainty might make it neutral, but the initial positive statement is stronger. Wait, but maybe the user is being cautious. Let me think again.\n\nThe key part is \"ürün iyi gerçekten\" which is clearly positive. The rest is about time showing effectiveness, which is more of a neutral observation. So combining both parts, the overall sentiment is still positive because the main assertion is that the product is good. The uncertainty doesn't negate the initial positive statement. Therefore, the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

If someone is saying the bodies are small, it might be negative if they were expecting larger sizes. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, in many cases, such a statement could indicate dissatisfaction, especially if the product didn't meet expectations.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's a neutral observation. For example, if someone is just stating a fact about the size without any emotional charge. However, in most cases, when people mention sizes being too small, it's usually a negative experience. They might be frustrated that the item doesn't fit properly. \n\nOn the other hand, could there be a positive connotation?

Then, \"rengi gidiyor\" translates to \"the color fades,\" which is a negative outcome for a product, probably something like paint or dye. The mention of 4-5 hours indicates that the fading happens quickly, adding to the dissatisfaction.\n\nThe user is clearly expressing disappointment with the product's quality and value for money. There's no positive language here, just complaints about the product not lasting and being a bad purchase. So the sentiment should be negative.

Ama yanında dezenfektan bulunsaymış keşke.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break it down into parts. The first part is \"Paketlemesi güzel,\" which translates to \"The packaging is nice.\" That's clearly a positive statement.\n\nThen there's the second part: \"Ama yanında dezenfektan bulunsaymış keşke.\" Translating that, it's something like \"But I wish there was disinfectant with it.\" The word \"keşke\" here expresses a desire or a wish, which usually indicates a negative sentiment because it's pointing out a missing feature.\n\nNow, the challenge is to determine the overall sentiment. The first part is positive, but the second part is a negative comment. However, in Turkish, when someone says \"keşke\" like this, they're often expressing disappointment or a suggestion for improvement. So even though there's a positive element, the presence of the negative wish might tip the balance.\n\nBut wait, sometimes people can have mixed sentiments. The user might be satisfied with the packaging but disappointed about the lack of disinfectant. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a clear negative statement, especially one that expresses a desire for something missing, it might be considered negative overall. Alternatively, if both parts are equally weighted, maybe neutral? But usually, the presence of a negative comment can override the positive unless they're balanced.\n\nLooking at examples given earlier: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. That's a case where the user is saying it's okay for the price, which is a neutral stance. In this case, the user has both a positive and a negative point. However, the negative part is a wish, not a strong complaint. It might be more of a mild negative.\n\nBut according to the rules, if there's any negative sentiment, even if mixed with positive, should it be labeled as negative? Or does the presence of both make it neutral?\n\nHmm. The example given for \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral because it's a balanced statement. In this case, the user is saying something good (packaging) but also pointing out a missing item (disinfectant). However, the negative part isn't a strong complaint; it's more of a suggestion. So maybe it's still positive? But the use of \"keşke\" might indicate dissatisfaction.\n\nAlternatively, since there are two parts with opposing sentiments, perhaps it's neutral. But I need to check if the system considers mixed sentiments as neutral or if the dominant sentiment takes over.\n\nIn many sentiment analysis models, mixed sentiments can be tricky. However, in this case, the first part is positive, and the second is a negative wish. The user might be satisfied overall but has a minor complaint. But depending on the context, maybe it's considered negative because of the expressed desire for something missing.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples: \"Yemek harikaydı.\" was positive, \"Zehirlendim.\" was negative, and \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. So in the case where there's a mix, like here, maybe it's considered negative because of the expressed wish for something missing. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is pointing out a feature that's missing but still acknowledges the packaging as good, perhaps it's more neutral. However, the presence of \"keşke\" might lean towards negative. Hmm.\n\nI think in this case, the correct label would be NEGATIVE because the user is expressing a wish for something that wasn't provided, which indicates dissatisfaction. Even though they mentioned the packaging was nice, the main point here is the missing disinfectant, which is a negative aspect.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The key words are \"bozuldu,\" which translates to \"spoiled\" or \"went bad.\" That's a negative outcome. The phrase \"bir ay olmadı\" suggests that something didn't last even a month, implying disappointment or frustration.\n\nLooking at the context, the user is likely talking about a product or service that didn't meet expectations. The use of \"bozuldu\" indicates a problem, which points towards a negative sentiment. There's no positive language here, and while there's no explicit complaint, the outcome is clearly unfavorable.\n\nI should check if there's any ambiguity. The sentence is straightforward—expressing that something spoiled quickly. No neutral terms are present. So the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a Turkish text that needs sentiment analysis. The text is: \"kokusu çok güzel yüzümü yumuşacık yaptı ama sanki gözenek açmaktansa daha çok doldurdu gibi\". \n\nFirst, I'll break it down. The first part says the scent is very nice and softened their face, which sounds positive. But then there's an \"ama\" (but), indicating a contrast. The second part mentions that instead of opening pores, it filled them more, which might be a negative point. \n\nSo, the user is expressing both positive and negative aspects. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a clear contradiction, sometimes the overall sentiment can be neutral. But I need to check the weight of each part. The initial positive comments are strong (\"çok güzel\", \"yumuşacık yaptı\"), but the latter part introduces a concern about the product's effect on pores.\n\nThe key here is whether the negative part outweighs the positive. Since the user mentions both good and bad effects, it might lean towards neutral. But sometimes, even with negatives, if the positives are strong enough, it could be positive. However, in this case, the use of \"ama\" suggests a correction to the initial positive statement, implying that the overall experience is mixed. \n\nLooking at the example given, when there's a mix, like \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (Okay for the price), it's neutral. Similarly here, the user is pointing out both benefits and drawbacks, so the sentiment might be neutral. But I need to make sure that the negative part isn't just a minor inconvenience. The mention of filling pores instead of opening them could be seen as a negative effect, which might tip the balance towards negative. However, the initial positive aspects are also strong.\n\nWait, but in Turkish, sometimes the structure can indicate that the second part is a consequence or a side effect. So maybe the user is saying that even though it's good for softening the skin, it has another effect (filling pores) which might not be desired. This could lead to an overall negative sentiment because the main function (opening pores) isn't achieved, but the product does something else. Alternatively, if the user is neutral about the second part, maybe it's a matter of opinion.\n\nBut in the examples provided, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. Here, the user is not just saying it's okay, but pointing out both pros and cons. So perhaps the sentiment is more negative because the product didn't perform as expected in one aspect. However, without more context on whether filling pores is considered good or bad, it's a bit tricky. But generally, if a skincare product is supposed to open pores and instead fills them, that might be seen as a negative outcome.\n\nSo considering all that, I think the label should be NEGATIVE because the main function isn't met, even though there are positive aspects.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The user wrote, \"Kullandım ama devamını getiremedim,\" which translates to \"I used it but couldn't continue.\" The key here is to determine the sentiment.\n\nFirst, the word \"kullandım\" (I used it) is neutral. Then there's \"ama\" (but), which often introduces a contrast. The second part is \"devamını getiremedim\" (couldn't continue). This suggests a negative experience because the user was unable to proceed further. \n\nEven though the first part is neutral, the overall sentiment is likely negative due to the inability to continue.

The user might be expressing frustration or disappointment, so that's a negative indicator. \n\nThen the second sentence: \"Bu tarz şeyleri emin olmadan internetden almayın\" translates to \"Don't buy things like these without being sure from the internet.\" The advice here is cautionary, suggesting that the person had a bad experience purchasing something online without proper verification. This implies a negative experience, reinforcing the negative sentiment.\n\nThere's no positive language here. The tone is warning and critical.

Regret is usually associated with negative feelings because it's about missing out on something.

Next, they talk about texture (kıvamı), color (rengi), and smell (kokusu) changing. They also mention using it for the first time and can't compare because they haven't used anything else before.

The rest talks about changes in texture, color, and smell, which could be neutral or slightly positive if they're okay with the changes. However, the uncertainty about whether it's fake adds some concern. But overall, there's no strong negative sentiment; they are just expressing a mixed experience without clear dissatisfaction.

The user says that the new product seems different, the smell is bad now, even though it still makes the hair soft. So there's a contrast between their past satisfaction and the current dissatisfaction with the new version. \n\nThe key here is to determine the overall sentiment. Even though they mention some positives about the product's effectiveness, the main issue is the negative change in scent. The user is pointing out a problem with the new product, which affects their experience negatively. However, they still acknowledge that the product works for softening hair. \n\nBut since the review starts with positive past experiences and ends with a complaint about the current product, the overall sentiment might lean more towards negative because the main issue (the bad smell) is a significant drawback. The fact that they mention the new product's scent is worse than before could be the dominant factor here. However, there's also a neutral aspect where they say it still works for softening hair. \n\nWait, but the user didn't explicitly state whether they are satisfied with the current product or not. They just mentioned the bad smell and that the effect is still there. So maybe the sentiment isn't entirely negative because they're still using it and acknowledging its effectiveness. But the complaint about the change in scent might be a strong enough point to label it as negative. Alternatively, since they didn't explicitly say they are unhappy with the product overall, but just pointing out a problem, it could be neutral.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. The user's main concern is the bad smell of the new product, which was not present before. They might be disappointed because their previous experience was positive, and the current version has a negative change. However, they still use it and mention that it works for softening hair. So maybe the sentiment isn't entirely negative but more neutral because they're pointing out both pros and cons. But the fact that they had to mention the bad smell as a significant issue might tip it towards negative.\n\nAlternatively, since they are still using the product and acknowledging its effectiveness, even with the bad smell, it could be neutral.

Then \"pek bisey anlamadım\" means \"I didn't understand much\" or \"I didn't get much.\" The word \"ama\" at the end is \"but,\" which might indicate a contrast.\n\nPutting it all together, the speaker seems to be expressing that they didn't understand much, but there's no clear positive or negative sentiment here. They're just stating a fact without showing strong emotions. The use of \"eh işte\" suggests a neutral acceptance rather than being happy or upset.

First, I need to understand the Turkish sentence. \"Rengi\" means \"the color,\" \"müthiş\" is an intensifier meaning \"very\" or \"extremely,\" \"çok\" also means \"very,\" and \"doğal\" translates to \"natural.\" So the sentence is saying \"The color is extremely very natural.\" \n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The words \"müthiş\" and \"çok\" are both positive intensifiers. When someone says something is \"extremely natural,\" that's a strong positive statement. There's no negative language here. Even though \"doğal\" can sometimes be neutral, in this context, it's being used positively to describe the color as very natural, which is a good thing.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but Turkish doesn't use sarcasm as much as English, and the sentence seems straightforward.

That's a negative point because the lack of visible change might indicate dissatisfaction.\n\nThen, they mention continuing use due to trusting the brand.

However, the overall sentiment seems to lean more towards negative because of the adverse effect and the uncertainty expressed at the end.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user wrote: \"Ağzı açık geldi saçı çok yumuşak yapıyor yalnız o yüzden iade etmedim.\" Translating that to English, it says something like, \"I came with my mouth open, the hair is very soft making, but because of that I didn't return it.\" Hmm, the user mentions that the product (probably a hair product) makes the hair very soft, which is a positive aspect. However, they also mention not returning it, which might be due to some issue. Wait, the phrase \"ağzı açık geldi\" is a bit confusing. Maybe it's an idiom or a typo? Could it mean \"I came with my mouth open,\" which doesn't make much sense here. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be \"açık ağzı\" (open mouth) but that still seems odd.\n\nLooking at the context, the user is talking about a product they used. They mention the hair being very soft (\"saçı çok yumuşak yapıyor\"), which is positive. But then they say \"yalnız o yüzden iade etmedim,\" meaning \"but because of that I didn't return it.\" Wait, if the product made their hair soft, why wouldn't they return it? Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps the user meant to say that despite the softness, they didn't return it, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe there was an issue with the product causing some problem (like making the hair too soft, leading to damage), so they didn't return it because they were satisfied with the result? That's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, \"ağzı açık geldi\" might be a typo for \"açık kalmak\" (to stay open) or something else. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, focusing on the parts that are clear: the user mentions the product makes hair soft (positive), but then says they didn't return it because of that. That seems contradictory unless there's a negative aspect not mentioned. Wait, maybe \"yalnız o yüzden\" is key here. \"Yalnız\" can mean \"only\" or \"but,\" so perhaps the structure is \"the hair is very soft, but because of that I didn't return it.\" But why wouldn't they return it if it's good? Maybe there was a problem with the product causing damage, and even though it made the hair soft, they didn't return it because they were satisfied with the result despite the issue. That would be negative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is saying that the product made their hair too soft (which could be bad), so they didn't return it because they liked the effect. But that's a stretch. The main point is that there's a mix of positive and negative elements. However, the instruction says to label as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL based on the overall sentiment.\n\nGiven that the user mentions a positive aspect (soft hair) but also an action (not returning it), which might imply dissatisfaction. But without clear negative words, it's tricky. The phrase \"yalnız o yüzden\" could indicate a contrast. If the product made the hair soft, but they didn't return it because of that, maybe there's confusion. However, in Turkish, sometimes people use phrases like \"yalnız o yüzden\" to mean \"but for that reason,\" which might not be negative. Alternatively, if the user is saying that despite the softness (which is good), they didn't return it, but that doesn't make sense unless there's another issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is complaining about the product making their hair too soft, leading to a problem, hence not returning it because they were satisfied with the result. That would be negative. But without explicit negative words like \"kötü\" or \"zor\", it's hard to tell. The main positive point is the softness, but the action of not returning might imply that there was an issue. However, in some contexts, people might keep a product even if they're not fully satisfied. \n\nConsidering all this, the sentiment seems mixed, but since we have to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL, and the main positive aspect is mentioned without clear negative words, maybe it's NEUTRAL. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the user didn't return it because of a problem (even though they mention the softness), that could be negative. However, the text doesn't explicitly state a complaint beyond the initial statement.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

All these are positive indicators. The user is happy with the product's effect and is repurchasing, which strongly points to a positive sentiment.\n\nI should check if there's any negative connotation.

They start by saying \"Kokusu mükemmel\" which means the smell is perfect – that's positive. Then they mention \"sabitleme kısmını da çok iyi yapıyor\" which translates to the fixing part does a great job, another positive point.\n\nBut then there's a转折 with \"fakat\" (but), indicating a negative aspect.

However, the initial positives are strong. Alternatively, maybe it's neutral because there's both positive and negative aspects. But I need to check the rules again. The labels are POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. If the text has both, but no clear dominant sentiment, then NEUTRAL. But if the negatives are more impactful, then NEGATIVE.\n\nIn this case, the user is saying the smell and fixing part are great (positive), but after applying, pores become more visible (negative). The negative is a specific issue, but it's not an overall bad experience.

But \"ses çıkarıyor\" (makes noise) could be seen as a problem. \n\nBut wait, the user might be stating a fact rather than expressing dissatisfaction. The phrase \"işe yarayıp yaramadığını gorcez\" suggests that the product's effectiveness is uncertain, which adds to the neutral aspect.

However, there's no explicit negative emotion like anger or disappointment.

First, I need to understand what this means in Turkish. \"Fiyat\" is price, \"çok\" means very, and \"uygun\" is suitable or appropriate. So the sentence translates to \"The price is very suitable.\" \n\nNow, determining the sentiment. The word \"uygun\" here is positive because it's indicating that the price is reasonable or good value. The adverb \"çok\" intensifies the positivity. There's no negative language here. Even though sometimes \"uygun\" can be neutral, in this context, combined with \"çok,\" it's clearly a positive statement.\n\nI should check if there are any hidden negatives, but I don't see any.

They start by saying \"Güzel ürün ama küçük,\" which translates to \"Good product but small.\" So there's a positive aspect here with \"güzel ürün\" (good product), but then they mention it's small, which could be a negative point.\n\nNext, they say, \"Bu fiyata daha iyi ürünler var sanki...\" meaning \"There seem to be better products at this price...\" That sounds like they're comparing and maybe feeling the product isn't worth the money, which is negative. \n\nThen they mention their hair: \"benim saçım işlem görmemiş ve çok yıpranmış bir saç olmadığı için büyük fark yaratmamış olabilir.\" Translating to \"Since my hair hasn't been treated and isn't very damaged, it might not have made a big difference.\" Here, they're explaining that the product didn't work as well because of their hair's condition. This part is more neutral because they're giving a reason why the product didn't perform better, not necessarily criticizing it.\n\nPutting it all together: They acknowledge the product is good (positive), but point out it's small and there are better options at the same price (negative). However, they also provide context about their hair condition, which is neutral. The overall sentiment seems mixed, but since the instructions require a single label, I need to determine if it leans more positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nThe user starts with a positive note but follows up with criticisms and comparisons, which might tip the balance towards negative. However, they also mention that their hair's condition might be why it didn't work better, which could be seen as a neutral explanation. But the main complaints about the product being small and there being better options at the same price are more negative.

The words \"kılları dökülme\" translate to \"hair loss\" or \"not shedding hair,\" and \"yapmıyor\" means \"is not doing.\" So the sentence is saying \"It doesn't cause hair loss\" or \"It's not causing hair shedding.\" Then there's \"norma,\" which might be a typo for \"normal\" or a name.\n\nNow, analyzing the sentiment. The user is talking about a product (maybe a shampoo or medication) that isn't causing hair loss. If someone is saying that a product doesn't have a negative side effect like hair loss, that's generally a positive thing. However, I should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning. But in this case, the sentence seems straightforward. The user is pointing out a benefit of the product, which would be positive.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a text in Turkish that needs to be analyzed for sentiment. The text is: \"ürünün kapatıcılığı çok az neredeyse yok ve açık tenler için ideal\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user is talking about a product's \"kapatıcılığı,\" which translates to something like coverage or opacity. They say it's very low, almost none, and then mention that it's ideal for fair skin.\n\nBreaking it down: The first part is negative because the product isn't covering well. But the second part is positive, saying it's good for fair skin. However, the overall sentiment might depend on context. If the product is supposed to have coverage (like a concealer or foundation), then low coverage would be bad. But if it's a product meant to be sheer, like a tinted moisturizer, then maybe it's intended to be lightweight.\n\nBut the user didn't specify the product type. However, the mention of \"açık tenler için ideal\" (ideal for fair skin) suggests that the lack of coverage is actually a positive trait for that specific use case. So even though the first part is negative, the overall sentiment might lean positive because the user is pointing out a benefit for a particular audience.\n\nWait, but in Turkish reviews, sometimes people mention both pros and cons. However, the structure here seems to be two separate points: the product has low coverage (which could be a con) and it's ideal for fair skin (a pro). But since the user is stating that the lack of coverage is almost none, which might not be desirable unless specified. However, the second part says it's ideal for fair skin, implying that the low coverage is actually a good thing in this context.\n\nSo combining both parts: The product has very low coverage (negative), but that makes it suitable for fair skin (positive). Depending on the intended use, but since the user mentions \"açık tenler için ideal,\" they might be highlighting that the lack of coverage is a positive feature. Therefore, the overall sentiment could be neutral because there's both a negative and a positive aspect. But maybe the main point is that it's not good for coverage but good for fair skin. However, if the product is supposed to have coverage, then the user is pointing out a flaw, making it negative. But without knowing the product type, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, the user might be saying that because the coverage is low, it's ideal for fair skin. So they're combining both aspects as a positive. Maybe the lack of coverage is actually a benefit here. In that case, the sentiment would be positive. But I need to check the words used. \"Çok az neredeyse yok\" (very little, almost none) is negative in terms of coverage, but \"ideal\" is positive. However, the user might be indicating that despite low coverage, it's good for fair skin. So maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because there are both negative and positive points. But I'm not sure.\n\nIn Turkish reviews, sometimes people mention a product's shortcomings but then say it's suitable for certain skin types. The key here is whether the user is expressing dissatisfaction or just stating facts. If they're saying that the coverage is low (which might be a con) but it's good for fair skin (a pro), the overall sentiment could be neutral because there are both aspects. However, if the product is supposed to have coverage and the user is pointing out that it doesn't, then it's negative. But without context on what the product is meant to do, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut given the information, I think the main point is that the product has low coverage (negative) but is ideal for fair skin (positive). Since both are mentioned, maybe the sentiment is neutral because there's a mix of positive and negative. However, sometimes in such cases, the user might be emphasizing the benefit despite the con, making it more positive. But I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, if the product is intended to have low coverage (like a sheer foundation), then the lack of coverage is actually a good thing, so the sentiment would be positive. But without knowing the product's purpose, it's ambiguous. However, the user might be indicating that the product isn't covering well but is suitable for fair skin. So maybe they're saying that even though it doesn't cover much, it works for fair skin. That could be a neutral or slightly positive sentiment.\n\nIn the absence of more context, I think the safest bet is to consider both aspects and label it as NEUTRAL because there's a mix of negative and positive points.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

They're not overly excited, but they have a positive expectation.\n\nLooking at the possible labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The words \"gerçekten\" means \"really\" or \"truly,\" which is a strong intensifier. Then \"çok güzel\" translates to \"very beautiful\" or \"very good.\" Both of these are positive adjectives. The next part is \"kokuyo,\" which is the present continuous form of \"koku,\" meaning \"smell.\" So, \"it's smelling really good.\" \n\nThen there's \"ve işe yarıyo.\" \"İşe yarayacak\" means \"will be useful\" or \"will work.\" The suffix \"-yo\" here is the present tense, so it's \"is being useful\" or \"works.\" Combining that, the sentence is saying something like \"It really smells very good and works.\"\n\nLooking at the adjectives used: \"çok güzel\" is definitely positive. The verb \"işe yarıyo\" implies that the product is effective or functional, which is also a positive attribute. There's no negative language here. Even though \"kokuyo\" might be neutral on its own, in this context, it's paired with \"çok güzel,\" making the overall sentiment positive.\n\nI should check if there's any sarcasm or hidden meaning, but Turkish doesn't use sarcasm as frequently as some other languages, and the sentence structure here is straightforward.

Then \"fotoğrafta göründüğü gibi geldi\" translates to \"it arrived as shown in the photo,\" which is neutral because it's just stating a fact without positive or negative connotation.\n\nThe second sentence starts with \"Yapısı ve rengiylede harika bir ürün\" – \"an amazing product in terms of structure and color.\" \"Harika\" means amazing, so that's definitely positive. \n\nCombining both parts, the overall sentiment is positive because there are clear positive statements about the product's price, appearance, and quality.

The phrase starts with \"Çok fark etmese de,\" which means \"Even though it doesn't make much of a difference.\" That part seems neutral or slightly negative because it's pointing out that something isn't making a significant impact. However, the second part is \"renkleri açıyor,\" which translates to \"it lightens the colors.\" The word \"açıyor\" can have different connotations. In the context of colors, \"açmak\" can mean to lighten or brighten them. \n\nNow, considering the overall sentiment: the user is saying that even though something isn't making a big difference (which could be neutral or slightly negative), it does have an effect on lightening the colors. The act of lightening colors might be seen as positive if the user is referring to something like a product that makes colors look brighter, but without more context, it's hard to tell. However, since there's no explicit positive or negative language beyond the neutral statement, the overall sentiment leans towards neutral. \n\nI should check if there are any strong positive or negative words. \"Çok fark etmese de\" is neutral, and \"renkleri açıyor\" is a factual statement without clear positive or negative connotations.

The phrase starts with \"Terletmemeli,\" which translates to \"shouldn't make you sweat\" or \"shouldn't cause sweating.\" That part might be negative because it's pointing out a flaw or something that should be avoided. However, the second part is \"gayet güzel,\" meaning \"very beautiful\" or \"excellent.\" \n\nSo there's a contrast here. The first part mentions a negative aspect (something that shouldn't happen), but the second part is very positive. But wait, in Turkish, sometimes the structure can be tricky. Let me check again. The user might have meant that despite not making you sweat (which could be a good thing), it's still beautiful. Or maybe \"terletmemeli\" is used in a way that's actually positive? Hmm.\n\nWait, \"terletmek\" means to make someone sweat. So if something shouldn't make you sweat, maybe it's implying that it's comfortable or doesn't cause discomfort. But the user wrote \"Terletmemeli dışın da gayet güzel.\" Maybe there's a typo here. Perhaps they meant \"Terletmeli\" instead of \"Terletmemeli\"? If it were \"Terletmeli,\" then it would mean \"should make you sweat,\" which could be negative, but combined with \"gayet güzel,\" it might be a positive statement. But the original text says \"Terletmemeli,\" so I have to go with that.\n\nSo the user is saying that something shouldn't make you sweat (maybe a product or experience), and then adds that it's very beautiful. The first part is a negative aspect (something that should not happen), but the second part is positive. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a mix of positive and negative, how do we classify it? But looking at the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is neutral. So maybe when there's a contrast, but the overall sentiment isn't clearly positive or negative, it might be neutral.\n\nBut in this case, the main point seems to be that despite not making you sweat (which could be seen as a positive), the thing is beautiful. However, the structure of the sentence is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe \"Terletmemeli\" is part of a phrase like \"terletmemeli, dışın da gayet güzel,\" which might mean \"It shouldn't make you sweat, but the outside is very beautiful.\" So there's a contrast between two aspects: one negative (shouldn't cause sweating) and one positive (beautiful). But in sentiment analysis, if the overall tone is more positive or more negative?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to say that even though it doesn't make you sweat (which could be a good thing), the outside is beautiful. So both parts are positive? Wait, \"terletmemeli\" is a bit ambiguous. If something shouldn't make you sweat, perhaps it's a good thing, so that part is positive. Then adding that the outside is very beautiful makes it more positive. But maybe the user meant that despite not making you sweat (which might be unexpected), the outside is still beautiful. So overall, the sentiment is positive.\n\nBut I need to check if \"terletmemeli\" here is used in a negative context. For example, if someone says \"Bu ürün terletmemeli,\" it could mean the product shouldn't make you sweat, which is a good thing. But maybe in some contexts, not making you sweat could be seen as a negative if it's supposed to do something else. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nGiven that the user provided examples where \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral, and here we have a mix of two parts: one possibly positive (shouldn't make you sweat) and another clearly positive (very beautiful). So combining them, the overall sentiment might be positive. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if \"terletmemeli\" is considered a negative aspect (something that should not happen), then it's a mix of negative and positive. However, in Turkish, sometimes the structure can imply that the first part is a minor issue but the second is a strong positive.\n\nIn the absence of clear context, I think the safest bet here is to consider \"gayet güzel\" as the dominant sentiment, making the overall label POSITIVE. But I need to be careful. Alternatively, if the user is pointing out that something shouldn't make you sweat (which could be a negative), but then says it's beautiful, maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because there's both positive and negative aspects. However, in the examples given by the user, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral, which is a balanced statement. Here, if the text has both a negative and a positive part, perhaps it's neutral.\n\nWait, but \"terletmemeli\" might not be a negative. If something shouldn't make you sweat, that could be a good thing (like a product that doesn't cause sweating). So maybe the user is saying that it doesn't make you sweat (positive) and is beautiful (positive), making the overall sentiment positive. But I'm still confused because \"terletmemeli\" is in the negative form. Wait, \"terletmek\" is to make someone sweat. So \"terletmemeli\" would be \"should not make you sweat.\" If that's a desired outcome, then it's positive. For example, if a product is supposed to keep you cool, so it shouldn't make you sweat. Then the user is saying that it doesn't make you sweat (positive) and is beautiful (positive). So both parts are positive, leading to POSITIVE.\n\nBut maybe the user intended \"terletmeli\" instead of \"terletmemeli,\" which would mean \"should make you sweat.\" In that case, if something should make you sweat but it's beautiful, that might be a negative. But since the original text says \"terletmemeli,\" I have to go with that.\n\nSo final conclusion: The user is saying that it shouldn't make you sweat (positive) and is very beautiful (positive), so overall POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

But then they mention some issues: \"Ancak iç lastiği direkt vücuda değiyor kaşındırma yapabilir.\" Which translates to \"However, the inner lining touches the body directly and may cause itching.\" That's a negative point.

Finally, they end with \"iade\" which means \"return,\" indicating they want a refund.\n\nNow, considering the structure: the review starts with positive feedback but then lists several problems. The presence of multiple negative points about the product's quality (itching, stitching coming apart) and the mention of returning the item strongly suggests dissatisfaction.

First, I need to understand what this means in Turkish. \"Fiyat olarak uygun\" translates to \"reasonable price\" or \"affordable price.\" The key words here are \"fiyat\" (price) and \"uygun\" (suitable/appropriate). \n\nNow, considering the sentiment labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The phrase is about the price being suitable, which generally has a positive connotation because it suggests that the product or service is priced fairly. However, I need to check if there's any context that might make this neutral.\n\nWait, but \"uygun\" can sometimes be neutral depending on the situation. For example, if someone says \"fiyat uygun ama kalite düşük,\" then it's a mix. But here, it's just stating that the price is suitable without any negative qualifiers. So in isolation, this should be positive because it's highlighting a positive aspect of the price.\n\nBut wait, maybe in some contexts, \"uygun\" could be neutral. However, in sentiment analysis, when something is described as suitable or appropriate without any negative context, it's usually positive. The user examples include \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which was labeled NEUTRAL. But that's different because \"okey\" is more neutral. Here, \"uygun\" is more positive.\n\nWait, but maybe the user considers \"uygun\" as neutral? Let me check the example again. In the example given by the user: \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" -> NEUTRAL. So when they say \"fiyat uygun,\" it's similar to \"okey\" in terms of being acceptable, but maybe not strongly positive. However, \"uygun\" can imply that it meets expectations, which is a positive sentiment.\n\nHmm, this might be a bit tricky. But according to standard sentiment analysis, \"uygun\" would lean towards positive because it indicates satisfaction with the price. Unless there's a specific context where it's neutral. Since the user hasn't provided any additional context, I should go with POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Hmm, \"boyamak\" can mean \"to paint,\" but in some contexts, it might be slang. Let me think.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that they are analyzing Turkish texts for sentiment. The sentence given is \"Kalitesiz asla boyamıyor.\" Breaking it down: \"Kalitesiz\" means low quality or poor quality. \"Asla\" is never. \"Boymak\" can mean to paint, but in some contexts, especially in slang, it might be used differently. However, without more context, I should stick to the literal translation.\n\nSo the sentence translates to \"Never paints if it's low quality.\" But that doesn't make much sense. Maybe the intended meaning is different. Wait, could \"boyamak\" here mean something else? Like, in some contexts, \"boyamak\" can be used as a verb for \"to dye,\" but again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. If the user meant \"boyanmak\" (to be painted), but that's speculative. However, given the information, I have to work with what's provided.\n\nAssuming the literal translation: \"Kalitesiz asla boyamıyor.\" So, if something is low quality, it never paints. That seems odd. Maybe the intended meaning is that a product of low quality doesn't last or isn't used? But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nHowever, looking at the sentiment. The words \"kalitesiz\" (low quality) and \"asla\" (never) might indicate a negative sentiment. If someone is saying that something of poor quality never does something, maybe they're expressing dissatisfaction. For example, if a product is low quality, it doesn't work properly, leading to frustration.\n\nBut the structure is a bit confusing. The subject isn't clear. Is the speaker talking about themselves not painting if the quality is low? Or is it about someone else? Without context, it's challenging. But based on the words used, \"kalitesiz\" is negative, and \"asla\" adds emphasis.\n\nConsidering the example given in the instructions: \"Zehirlendim.\" (I got poisoned) was labeled as NEGATIVE. Similarly, if the text contains negative terms like \"kalitesiz,\" even if the structure is a bit unclear, it's safer to label it as NEGATIVE.

Translating that, it seems like they're saying \"but the desired black matte finish isn't there.\" This part sounds negative because they're expressing disappointment that the product doesn't meet their expectation of having a black matte finish.\n\nSo, the text has both positive and negative elements. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's a mix, we need to determine which aspect dominates. The first part is positive, but the second part is a complaint about a missing feature. Since the user is pointing out a specific drawback that wasn't met, this might lean more towards negative. But sometimes, if the overall context isn't clear, neutral could be considered.\n\nWait, but the example given in the instructions had a similar case where \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was labeled as NEUTRAL. That's because it's a mixed sentiment but not strongly positive or negative. In this case, the user is pointing out both a positive aspect and a negative one. However, the presence of a complaint about a missing feature might tip the balance towards negative. But I need to check if the overall sentiment is more negative than positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's neutral because they're just stating facts without strong emotional language. The words used aren't extremely negative or positive. They mention a problem but also a positive aspect. However, in some cases, even a single negative point can make the whole sentiment negative, especially if it's about not meeting expectations.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. The user is talking about a product (maybe makeup or something similar). The first part says the tip is soft and spreads well, which is positive. But then they mention that the desired black matte finish isn't there. This seems like a significant issue for someone looking for that specific finish. So even though there's a positive point, the main complaint might make it negative.\n\nBut in sentiment analysis, sometimes the presence of both can lead to neutral if the positives and negatives balance out. However, the examples given by the user had \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" as neutral, which is a mixed but not strongly negative or positive. In this case, the complaint might be more impactful, leading to a negative label.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's neutral because the user is just stating their experience without strong emotional words. The key here is whether the sentiment is clearly positive, negative, or neutral. Since there's both a positive and a negative point, but no clear dominance, perhaps neutral is the right choice. However, in some contexts, pointing out a missing feature could be seen as more negative.\n\nI think I need to go with NEGATIVE because the user is expressing dissatisfaction about not getting the desired finish, which might be a critical aspect for them. Even though there's a positive note, the main issue here is the absence of something important, leading to a negative sentiment.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The key phrases here are \"dinlendiriyo\" which means relaxing or calming, and \"fena değil\" which translates to \"not bad\" or \"okay\". \n\nNow, considering the sentiment. The user is talking about a product (probably a skincare item) that's making their face relax, which is a positive effect. However, they use \"fena değil\", which isn't overly enthusiastic but still indicates a neutral to slightly positive sentiment. \n\nBut wait, in Turkish, \"fena değil\" can sometimes be used to express mild satisfaction. It's not strongly negative, so the overall sentiment here leans more towards positive than neutral. The main action is the product relaxing the face, which is a good thing. So I think the label should be POSITIVE.\n\nWait, but maybe some might see \"fena değil\" as neutral. However, in context, since the effect is positive (relaxing the skin), even if the user isn't overly excited, the sentiment is still positive. So I'll go with POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

They also say they are satisfied with the company. These are all positive points.\n\nThen the negatives: The user is not satisfied with the product itself. It causes excessive sweating and makes their skin oily. They have combination skin prone to acne, so it's not suitable for them. Also, they mention that the size isn't ideal for those considering buying, and even though the price is reasonable compared to other brands, they can't use it because of their skin type.\n\nNeutral parts: The user mentions that the texture isn't too thick and the size is sufficient, but this might be subjective. However, since they ended up not liking it due to their skin type, these points are overshadowed by the negative aspects.\n\nOverall, the review has a mix of positive and negative elements, but the main sentiment seems to lean towards negative because the product didn't work for them despite the good delivery and packaging.

So \"Beğenmedim\" translates to \"I did not like it\" or \"I didn't approve.\" \n\nNow, looking at the sentiment labels: POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. The user's message is clearly expressing a negative feeling towards something. There's no ambiguity here. The person is stating they didn't like it, which directly points to a negative sentiment.\n\nI should check if there's any context I'm missing. But the text is straightforward.

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this analysis. The user provided a Turkish text that needs to be categorized as POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. The first part says \"Ürün fazla esnek.\" which translates to \"The product is too flexible.\" That might be a negative point because being too flexible could imply it's not durable. Then they mention \"İki yıkamada kendini bırakacak cinsten.\" which means \"It's the kind that will give up after two washes.\" That definitely sounds negative, indicating the product doesn't last long.\n\nHowever, the next part is a bit tricky: \"Ama puanım çöpten çıkarmış gibi paramparça bir kutuda ürünü gönderen satıcıya.\" Translating this, it's saying something like \"But the seller who sent the product in a broken box has made my score go up from trash.\" Wait, that seems contradictory. The user is mentioning that despite the negative aspects of the product (flexibility and not lasting), they're giving a positive note about the seller's packaging? Or maybe it's sarcastic?\n\nWait, \"paramparça bir kutuda\" means \"a broken box,\" so the seller sent the product in a damaged package. The user says \"puanım çöpten çıkarmış gibi\" which might mean their rating (puan) was lifted from trash (çöp), implying that even though the product had issues, the seller's action of sending it in a broken box somehow improved their score? That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a translation error here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"paramparça\" is used differently. Let me check again. \"Paramparça\" can mean \"in pieces\" or \"broken.\" So the seller sent the product in a broken box. The user might be criticizing the seller for that, but then says their score was lifted from trash. That's confusing. Maybe the user is saying that despite the negative aspects of the product (flexibility and not lasting), they're giving a neutral or positive rating because the seller's packaging was bad? Or maybe it's a mix of negative points about the product and the seller, but the overall sentiment is negative.\n\nPutting it all together: The product is too flexible and doesn't last long (negative). The seller sent it in a broken box (another negative). However, the user mentions their score went up from trash, which might be sarcastic or indicate that despite these negatives, they're giving a neutral rating. But the overall sentiment seems to lean more towards negative because both product quality and packaging are criticized. However, the mention of \"puanım çöpten çıkarmış gibi\" could imply some positive aspect, but it's unclear. Maybe the user is confused or there's a translation error.\n\nConsidering all that, the main points are negative about the product and seller, so the label should be NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

Keşke biraz da indirim olsa :(\"\n\nFirst part is positive: \"La Roche sen mükemmelsin\" translates to \"La Roche, you're perfect.\" That's clearly a compliment, so positive sentiment here.\n\nNext sentence: \"Hiç tedirgin olmayın sepete ekleyin alın.\" Which means \"Don't worry, add to cart and buy.\" This is encouraging the purchase, so still positive.\n\nThen the last part: \"Keşke biraz da indirim olsa :(\" Translates to \"I wish there was a discount too.\" The use of \":(\" indicates disappointment or a negative feeling about the lack of discount. So here's a negative sentiment.\n\nNow, the challenge is determining the overall label. The user has both positive and negative elements. But in sentiment analysis, if there are mixed sentiments, we need to see which one dominates. However, the instructions don't mention handling mixed cases. The example given for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is more of a neutral statement.\n\nBut in this case, the user starts with strong positive statements, then ends with a negative comment about no discount. But the overall context might be that despite the negative part, the main sentiment is still positive because they are recommending the product. However, the presence of a clear negative expression (\":(\") might tip it towards negative. Wait, but in the examples provided earlier, \"Keşke biraz da indirim olsa\" would be considered neutral? Or maybe negative?\n\nLooking back at the rules: The user wants the label to be POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. If there's a mix, how is that handled? The example given for neutral was a statement that's neither positive nor negative. But here, the user has both positive and negative elements.\n\nBut in the examples, when there was a wish for something (like \"Keşke biraz da indirim olsa\"), it might be considered as a mild negative because they're expressing a desire for something not present. However, the overall sentiment of the review is still positive because they are praising the product and encouraging purchase.\n\nBut maybe in this case, since there's an explicit expression of disappointment (the \":(\"), the label should be NEGATIVE. But I need to check if that's the case. Alternatively, it could be considered as a mixed sentiment, but according to the rules, we have to choose one label.\n\nIn some sentiment analysis models, the presence of both positive and negative can lead to neutral if they balance out. However, in this case, the positive statements are stronger (praising the product) while the negative is a minor complaint about no discount. So maybe overall it's still positive. But the user might be conflicted.\n\nAlternatively, since there's an explicit negative emotion (the sad face), perhaps the label should be NEGATIVE. However, in the examples provided by the user, \"Keşke biraz da indirim olsa\" was considered neutral. Wait, no, that example wasn't given. The example for neutral was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is a neutral statement.\n\nSo maybe the presence of the sad face here indicates a negative sentiment. But the overall message is still positive. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe in this case, since there's both positive and negative elements but the main intent is to recommend the product despite the wish for a discount, it might be considered as POSITIVE with a minor negative note. However, according to strict rules, if there's any negative sentiment, even if mixed, should it override?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the label is NEUTRAL because it's a mix of positive and negative. But the examples don't have that case. The user instructions say to use the three labels. If the text has both positive and negative elements, but no clear dominance, perhaps it's considered as NEUTRAL.\n\nBut in this case, the majority of the text is positive (praising the product, encouraging purchase), while the last part is a minor complaint. So maybe overall POSITIVE. However, the presence of the sad face might indicate that the user is not fully satisfied, hence NEGATIVE. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is still recommending the product despite wanting a discount, it's more positive. The negative part is just a wish, not a strong complaint. So maybe POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

However, they add a caution: \"yüzünüze çok bastırmadan temizleyin çünkün tahriş edebiliyor.\" This means \"Don't press it too much on your face because it can irritate.\" So there's a warning here about potential irritation if not used properly.\n\nNow, the challenge is determining the overall sentiment. The first part is positive, but the latter part introduces a negative aspect. However, the user isn't complaining about the product itself causing irritation; they're advising others on how to use it correctly. The mention of irritation is more of a caution rather than a complaint. The user seems satisfied with the product's effectiveness but wants to highlight proper usage to avoid issues.\n\nConsidering the balance between positive feedback and the warning, the overall sentiment leans towards positive because the main experience with the product is good, and the negative part is a precaution rather than a flaw in the product itself. So the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this user review step by step. The user starts by saying \"Ürün çok güzel, kokusu ve dokusu çok hoş,\" which translates to \"The product is very nice, the smell and texture are very pleasant.\" That's definitely positive.\n\nThen they mention \"daha yeni kullanmaya başladım etki ettikçe yorumu düzenlerim.\" So they're saying they just started using it and will update their review as they see the effects. This part is neutral because they haven't formed a final opinion yet.\n\nNext, \"Fiyatı çok uygun ve kargo tam zamanında geldi.\" Here, they praise the price as very reasonable and the delivery arrived on time. That's another positive point.\n\nHowever, the last sentence says \"bayadır kullanıyorum bir faydası olmadı lekelere.\" Translating to \"I've been using it for a long time but there's no benefit from it, stains.\" This is negative because they're pointing out that despite long-term use, there's no benefit and it causes stains.\n\nSo the review has both positive and negative elements. But according to the rules, I need to determine the overall sentiment. Since the user mentions both positive aspects (product quality, price, delivery) and a significant negative aspect (no benefits, staining), but the negative part is about the product's effectiveness over time. However, the initial experience is positive. But in some cases, if there's a contradiction, maybe it's neutral? Wait, but the user also says they haven't formed a final opinion yet because they just started using it. However, the last part contradicts that by saying they've been using it for a long time with no benefit. That seems conflicting. Maybe the user is confused or made a mistake in their review. But as per the analysis, there are both positive and negative points. However, the instruction says to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL. Since there's a mix but the final part about long-term use with no benefit might be more impactful. Alternatively, since they mentioned both pros and cons, maybe it's neutral? But in some cases, if the negative is stronger, it could be negative. However, the initial parts are positive. Hmm. The user starts with positive comments, then mentions a negative effect after long-term use. So overall, the sentiment might be mixed but according to the rules, we have to pick one label. In such cases, maybe the dominant sentiment is neutral because there's both positive and negative aspects without a clear majority. But I need to check if the user's final statement overrides the previous positives. The last part says \"bayadır kullanıyorum bir faydası olmadı lekelere\" which is a strong negative point about effectiveness. However, they also mention that they will update their review as they see the effects, but then contradict by saying they've been using it for a long time with no benefit. This inconsistency might make the overall sentiment neutral because there's both positive and negative elements without a clear conclusion.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user wrote, \"Dolgunlaştırma yapmıyor ama güzel bir parlatıcı.\" Translating that to English, it means \"It doesn't do fillers but it's a nice whitening agent.\" \n\nFirst, I need to determine the sentiment here. The sentence has two parts connected by \"ama,\" which is Turkish for \"but.\" The first part is negative: the product doesn't perform fillers, which might be a downside. However, the second part is positive: it's a good whitening agent.\n\nNow, the challenge is to figure out if the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Since there's both a negative and a positive aspect, but the user is pointing out a drawback followed by a positive feature. In such cases, sometimes the overall sentiment can be neutral because it's a mix of both. However, depending on context, if the positive aspect is more emphasized, it might lean towards positive.\n\nBut in this case, the user mentions a negative point first and then a positive one. The use of \"ama\" suggests that despite the lack of fillers, the product still has a good feature. However, since both aspects are present without clear emphasis on which is more important, the sentiment might be neutral. Alternatively, if the positive aspect is considered more significant, it could be positive.\n\nWait, but in some cases, when there's a negative and a positive, but the overall evaluation isn't clearly leaning one way, it's safer to go with neutral. However, sometimes the presence of a positive statement can override the negative. But here, since both are mentioned without clear dominance, I think neutral is appropriate.

So putting that together, maybe they're talking about a product's appearance being dull and pale? The emojis are all thumbs down, which are definitely negative.\n\nBut wait, could there be any positive connotation here? The words themselves don't seem positive.

Now, I need to determine the sentiment here.\n\nFirst, the key words are \"kuru\" which means dry. In the context of a product arriving dry, this could be negative because it might indicate damage or not meeting expectations. However, sometimes \"kuru\" could be neutral if it's just stating a fact without any emotional charge. But in most cases, receiving a product in a dry condition is undesirable, especially if it's something that should be moist or fresh. So the sentiment here is likely negative.\n\nI need to make sure there are no positive words or context that might change this. The sentence is straightforward and doesn't have any positive terms.

The user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product (probably clothing or something that came in a size they expected but was too large). \n\nEven though there's a mention of buying their own body, which might be a typo or slang, the main sentiment here is clearly negative.

The user mentions buying it as a gift, which adds context that they were trying to do something nice but it backfired. The word \"rezil oldum\" translates to \"I was disgraced,\" which strongly indicates a negative emotion.\n\nLooking at the keywords: \"hemen yırtıldı\" (tore immediately) is clearly a problem with the product's quality. \"Rezil oldum\" is a strong expression of embarrassment or shame, which is definitely negative.

The person is complimenting the scent, which is a good thing.\n\nSecond part: \"Paketleme Allah'a emanet.\" means \"Packaging is entrusted to Allah.\" Hmm, this is a bit tricky. In Turkish culture, saying something is entrusted to Allah can have different connotations. It might imply that the packaging is left to divine will, which could be neutral or even negative depending on context. But since the first part is positive and the second part is more about the packaging being handled by Allah, maybe it's a way of expressing trust in God's plan rather than a complaint. However, without more context, it's hard to tell if there's an underlying issue with the packaging.\n\nBut looking at the overall sentiment, the user starts with a positive statement and then mentions something about the packaging. Since the second part isn't clearly negative or positive, but the first part is strongly positive, maybe the overall sentiment leans towards positive. However, sometimes in Turkish, when people say \"Allah'a emanet\" it can be a way of saying that they're not responsible for it anymore, which might be neutral. But I think in this case, since the user didn't express dissatisfaction with the packaging, just mentioned it's entrusted to Allah, it's more neutral. However, the first part is positive. \n\nWait, but the instructions say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. If there's a mix, which one takes precedence? The example given for \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was NEUTRAL. So maybe if parts are mixed, but the overall sentiment isn't clearly negative or positive, it's neutral. But here, the first part is definitely positive, and the second is neutral. However, the user might be expressing that the packaging is not their responsibility, which could be a slight negative, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is just stating facts: the smell is good, and the packaging is entrusted to Allah. So overall, the sentiment is positive because the main part is positive. But I'm not entirely certain. However, since the second part doesn't have a clear negative or positive emotion, it might be considered neutral. But the presence of a positive statement might make the whole thing positive. \n\nWait, but in the examples given, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was NEUTRAL because it's a balanced view. Here, the user has a positive comment and then a neutral one. So maybe the overall label is POSITIVE because the main sentiment is positive. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the second part implies something negative, like the packaging isn't good, but that's not stated. \n\nI think the safest bet here is to go with POSITIVE since the first part is clearly positive and the second part doesn't introduce a negative sentiment. The mention of Allah might be more of a cultural nuance without affecting the overall sentiment negatively.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, I should check the words used. \"Altı kırıklı\" translates to \"six broken\" or \"six cracked,\" which sounds negative. Then there's \"on dışında\" meaning \"except ten,\" which might be a bit confusing. But the key part is \"her şey mükembel.\" \"Mükembel\" means something like \"excellent\" or \"superb,\" which is positive.\n\nSo, the sentence seems to have both negative and positive elements. The user is saying that except for six broken items (maybe products?), everything else is excellent. But how does that balance out? In sentiment analysis, if there's a mix, but the overall tone leans more towards one side. Here, even though there's a negative part, the main point is that everything else is great. However, the presence of a negative aspect might make it neutral. Or maybe the positive outweighs the negative.\n\nWait, but in some cases, mentioning a problem and then praising the rest could be seen as mixed, but since the user has to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL, I need to decide which is more dominant. The phrase \"her şey mükembel\" is strong positive. However, the mention of six broken items might indicate a negative experience. But maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because it's pointing out both good and bad aspects. Alternatively, if the majority of the sentence is positive, it could be POSITIVE. Hmm.\n\nBut in Turkish, sometimes the structure can be tricky. Let me think again. The user says \"Altı kırıklı on dışında her şey mükembel.\" So, six are broken, except ten, everything else is excellent. Wait, maybe there's a translation error here? Maybe it's supposed to be \"Altı kırık, on dışında her şey mükemmel\" which would mean \"Six broken, except ten, everything else is perfect.\" But even so, the presence of broken items (negative) and the rest being perfect (positive). It depends on context. If the user is talking about a product where six are defective but others are good, it's mixed. However, in sentiment analysis, if there's both positive and negative elements without clear dominance, it might be neutral.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is emphasizing that despite some issues (six broken), everything else is great, which could lean more towards positive. But I'm not sure. The instruction says to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there's both negative and positive aspects, but no clear dominance, it might be neutral. However, sometimes in such cases, the presence of a strong positive can make it positive. But I need to be careful here.\n\nAnother angle: \"Altı kırıklı\" could be a typo for \"altılık kırık,\" but that's speculative. Assuming the original text is correct, \"Altı kırıklı on dışında her şey mükembel.\" The key is that despite six broken items (negative), everything else is excellent (positive). So it's a mix. But in sentiment analysis, if there's both positive and negative without clear dominance, it's neutral. Therefore, the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user says, \"Muhteşem bir ürün tedirginlikle aldım ama bu fiyata göre çok iyi bir ürün saçlarımı yumuşacık yaptı saç kremi kullanmama bile gerek kalmıyor kokusu zaten bir harika.\" \n\nBreaking it down: \"Muhteşem bir ürün\" translates to \"An amazing product,\" which is clearly positive. Then there's \"tedirginlikle aldım\" meaning \"I bought it with hesitation,\" which might indicate some initial doubt, but the rest of the sentence seems to counter that. The user mentions that the product made their hair soft, eliminated the need for a hair cream, and the smell is a \"harika\" (wonderful). \n\nThe conjunction \"ama\" (but) here is used to contrast the initial hesitation with the positive outcome. However, the overall sentiment is dominated by the positive aspects: the product's effectiveness and pleasant scent. The mention of not needing a hair cream anymore adds to the satisfaction. Even though there was initial hesitation, the subsequent praise outweighs that. \n\nI need to make sure there are no negative words that I missed. Words like \"tedirginlik\" (hesitation) might be seen as negative, but in context, it's part of the user's experience leading to a positive outcome. The key here is that the overall sentiment is positive despite the initial hesitation. \n\nSo, the label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, translating the sentence might help. \"The color is much lighter than expected.\" So the person is talking about a product's color being different from what they anticipated. The key words here are \"beklediğimden çok açık\" which means \"much lighter than expected.\"\n\nNow, I need to figure out the sentiment. If someone says something is lighter than expected, that could be either positive or negative depending on context. For example, if they were expecting a darker color and it's lighter, maybe they're disappointed. But if they wanted a light color and it's even lighter, maybe they're happy.\n\nBut in this case, the sentence doesn't have any explicit positive or negative words. It's just stating a fact that the color is lighter than expected. There's no indication of satisfaction or dissatisfaction. The user might be neutral because they're just pointing out a difference without expressing approval or disapproval.\n\nSo, considering the lack of emotional language and the factual statement, the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The user provided the text: \"Çok heveslenerek aldım fakat çok ince tüyleri almıyor.\" I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. The first part is \"Çok heveslenerek aldım\" which translates to \"I bought it with a lot of enthusiasm.\" That sounds positive because buying something with high excitement usually indicates satisfaction. But then there's the second part: \"fakat çok ince tüyleri almıyor.\" The word \"fakat\" means \"but,\" so this is a contrast. \"Çok ince tüyleri almıyor\" would be \"it doesn't have very fine fibers\" or \"it doesn't get very fine hairs.\" Depending on context, maybe the product is supposed to have fine fibers, like a fabric or something similar. The user is pointing out a negative aspect here.\n\nSo there's a mix of positive and negative sentiments. However, in sentiment analysis, when there's a contrast like this, the overall sentiment might lean towards negative if the second part is a significant drawback. But I need to check the balance. The first part is positive but the second part introduces a problem. However, the user might be expressing disappointment despite initial enthusiasm. \n\nBut according to the rules, I have to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since there's both positive and negative elements, but the presence of \"fakat\" (but) usually indicates that the second part is more important. So the overall sentiment might be negative because the user is pointing out a flaw despite initial enthusiasm. Alternatively, if the product is something like a hair removal device, not getting fine hairs could be a negative point. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's neutral? But I think the presence of both positive and negative aspects would make it mixed, but since we have to choose one label, the dominant sentiment might be negative because the user is highlighting a problem they encountered after initial excitement. So I'll go with NEGATIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

The positive part is about choosing a recommended brand, but the negative part is about not seeing any effect. However, the delivery part is neutral.

However, they do mention that if you apply it 1-2 times and let it spread, the color becomes solid on the lips, so there's a positive aspect in terms of usability.

That could indicate some level of dissatisfaction or lack of engagement. However, they also say their expectations are very high. High expectations might suggest that they believe the product has potential or they hope for better results in the future.\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment words: \"beklentim çok büyük\" (my expectations are very big). The word \"büyük\" here is positive because it's about having high hopes. But the first part talks about not using it regularly, which might be negative.

However, the context here is important. The user might be saying that the price is appropriate for the brand, but without more information, it's hard to tell if they're satisfied or just stating a fact.\n\nIn sentiment analysis, \"neutral\" is used when there's no clear positive or negative emotion.

But I should check if there's any underlying sentiment. \n\nWait, sometimes in Turkish, phrases like \"uygun fiyat\" can imply that the price is good, which could be positive. However, without additional context like comparison to other brands or explicit positive words, it's safer to classify as neutral. The user might just be stating an observation rather than expressing a feeling.\n\nSo considering the rules again: if there's no clear positive or negative sentiment, it's neutral.

Or could it be neutral because there are both positive and negative elements?\n\nWait, in Turkish, when someone says something like \"I got a good deal but it's a bit thin,\" they might be emphasizing that even though there's a flaw, the price was worth it. So the overall sentiment might lean positive because the main point is the satisfaction with the price. However, some might argue that the negative aspect makes it neutral.\n\nBut according to the rules, I need to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. The key here is whether the positive outweighs the negative. Since the user mentions the price as \"çok uygun\" (very reasonable) which is a strong positive, and the negative part is just a minor complaint (\"biraz inceydi\" - a bit thin). So the overall sentiment is likely POSITIVE because the main point of satisfaction is the price.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

The user is talking about a product, probably some kind of paint or coating, since they mention \"boyalardan killari\" (dirt from paints) and \"paletimi mahvetti\" (destroyed my palette). They also say they tried washing it off but it didn't work, leading them to throw it away. The last part is a warning to others not to buy it because it's cheap.\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment. The user is clearly frustrated. Words like \"inanilmaz kil dokuluyor\" (unbelievable dirt is forming), \"yikadim sildim olmadi\" (I washed and wiped but it didn't work), \"paletimi mahvetti\" (destroyed my palette), \"perisan oldum\" (I was ruined), and \"cope atildi\" (thrown away) all indicate negative experiences. The warning at the end reinforces the negative sentiment, advising others not to buy the product due to its low quality despite being cheap.\n\nThere's no positive language here. Even though they mention it's cheap (\"ucuz\"), that's presented as a negative point because the product didn't work and caused damage.

But the initial positive comments are strong. \n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" was neutral. Here, there's both positive and negative elements. The challenge is determining which part dominates. If the product caused an adverse effect (drying), that might be a stronger negative point.

The word \"normal\" in Turkish can be neutral, but depending on context, it might lean positive or negative. However, in this case, since they're saying the quality is normal for the price, it's more of a neutral statement.

The user wrote, \"Çabuk bitti, ama kullanışlı.\" Translating that to English, it's something like \"It finished quickly, but it was useful.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the sentiment here. The first part is \"Çabuk bitti,\" which could be positive because finishing quickly might be seen as a good thing, especially if it's about a task or a process that was supposed to take longer. However, the second part is \"ama kullanışlı,\" where \"ama\" means \"but,\" which usually introduces a contrast. The word \"kullanışlı\" means useful or practical, which is positive.\n\nWait, but the structure here is a bit tricky. The user might be saying that even though it finished quickly (which could be neutral or slightly negative if they expected it to last longer), it was still useful. But in Turkish, sometimes \"çabuk bitti\" can have a negative connotation depending on context. For example, if something is supposed to last and it ends too soon, that's negative. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut the second part is definitely positive. The conjunction \"ama\" here might be used to emphasize that despite the quick finish, the usefulness is a positive aspect. So maybe the overall sentiment is positive because the user highlights the usefulness as a positive point. Alternatively, if the quick finish was unexpected and negative, but the usefulness compensates, leading to neutral.\n\nBut in the absence of more context, I think the key here is that the user ends with a positive statement about being useful. The first part might be neutral or slightly negative, but the second part is clearly positive. Since the overall sentiment is determined by the dominant emotion, and the user ends on a positive note, maybe it's positive. However, sometimes in Turkish, using \"ama\" can indicate that the second part is the main point. So if the main point is that it was useful despite finishing quickly, then the sentiment is positive.\n\nAlternatively, if the quick finish is a negative aspect and the usefulness is a positive, but they are contrasting, maybe neutral. But I think in this case, since the user mentions \"kullanışlı\" which is a strong positive, the overall label should be POSITIVE.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"POSITIVE\"}"

Then \"sabırsızlanıyorum\" translates to \"can't wait\" or \"impatient,\" which usually has a negative connotation. But in this context, the impatience is because they're excited to use the product. \n\nSo even though \"sabırsızlanıyorum\" might sound negative on its own, here it's expressing eagerness. The overall sentiment seems positive because the user is happy about the quick delivery and can't wait to use the product. There's no negative words indicating dissatisfaction or problems. \n\nI should check if there's any hidden sarcasm, but the sentence structure doesn't suggest that.

Positive would be if they're happy or satisfied. Negative if they're upset or dissatisfied.

The user is saying that the product is average or standard considering its price. They're not complaining about the price being too high, but also not praising it excessively. It's more of an objective assessment based on cost.\n\nSo combining both parts: the first part is positive, the second is neutral. But since the overall sentiment isn't strongly negative or positive, maybe the whole thing leans towards neutral? Wait, but the first part is positive. However, the second part might temper that. But in Turkish, when someone says \"fiyatına göre normal,\" they might mean that it's acceptable for the price, which could be seen as a neutral comment rather than negative. \n\nSo the user is expressing satisfaction with the product (positive) but also stating that the price is average, which doesn't add strong positive or negative sentiment. The overall sentiment might still be positive because the main adjective used is \"güzel.\" However, sometimes in such cases, if there's a mix, it could be neutral. But I think here the primary sentiment is positive with a neutral modifier. \n\nBut according to the rules, we need to choose between POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. Since the main part is positive and the second part doesn't negate that, maybe it's still positive. However, some might argue that \"normal\" implies lack of enthusiasm. But in Turkish context, saying something is normal for the price could be a neutral observation. \n\nHmm.

The user says: \"Temizleme jeli ile birlikte kullanıyorum tek başına jel kurutuyor tonikleme yapıncada yağlı kalıyor pek memnun olduğum söylenemez.\" \n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. They mention using the cleansing gel together with something else (probably another product), but when used alone, the gel dries out. Then, when they use it with a toner, it becomes oily. The last part is \"pek memnun olduğum söylenemez,\" which translates to \"I can't really say I'm satisfied.\"\n\nSo the user is talking about their experience with the product. They're not happy because using it alone causes dryness, and using it with a toner makes it oily. That's a negative experience. The key words here are \"kurutuyor\" (dries out) and \"yağlı kalıyor\" (stays oily), which are negative effects. Also, the final statement clearly expresses dissatisfaction.\n\nI need to check if there's any positive aspect mentioned. They do mention using it with another product, but that doesn't seem to be a positive point; rather, it's about the product not working well in different scenarios.

The key words here are \"dusunmuyorum\" which is \"don't think\" and \"yaradigini\" related to \"useful\".\n\nNow, looking at the sentiment. The person is expressing a negative opinion about something not being useful. In the given tags, NEGATIVE is for expressions of dissatisfaction or negative feelings. This clearly fits into NEGATIVE because they're stating that it doesn't work or isn't helpful. There's no ambiguity here; the sentiment is straightforwardly negative.

I need to analyze this and determine if it's positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nFirst, breaking down the sentence. \"Çok ince\" translates to \"Very thin.\" Depending on context, that could be positive or negative. If someone is talking about a fabric, maybe positive. But if it's about a person, maybe negative. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nThen there's \"Ama bayağı büyük\" which means \"But quite big.\" Again, \"bayağı\" can be strong, but whether that's positive or negative depends on the situation. If they're talking about something like a product, maybe size is a neutral aspect. But combined with \"çok ince,\" there might be a contrast.\n\nSince there's no clear context, I have to go with the words themselves. Both parts are descriptive without obvious sentiment.

The phrase \"pek\" is used to emphasize that the expectation wasn't met. In Turkish, when someone says something didn't meet their expectations, it's usually a negative sentiment.

The reason given is that the scent applied doesn't match the catalog. That suggests dissatisfaction with the product's quality or accuracy compared to what was advertised.\n\nThe use of \"İade edıyorum\" (I'm returning) indicates a negative experience because they're taking back the item. The phrase \"kataloğa bastıkları kokuyla alakası yok\" points out a discrepancy between the product's scent and the catalog description, which is a clear complaint. \n\nThe emojis used are 😒😒, which are expressions of disappointment or frustration. These further reinforce the negative sentiment.\n\nSo putting it all together, the user is expressing dissatisfaction with the product due to a mismatch in the scent as described in the catalog.

The key here is the overall sentiment. Even though there's a mention of a discount (which could be neutral or slightly positive), the main points are negative: \"fazla kullanışlı değil\" (not very useful) and \"kullanmıyorum\" (not using it).

The first part is positive: the cream can be used daily, which is a good point. Then they mention that they noticed their skin tone became even, which is another positive effect.\n\nBut then there's a contrast with \"ama\" (but), indicating a negative point. They say that dark spots are opened, which might mean the product caused more visible dark spots or didn't improve them. However, the phrasing \"açtığını söylemem\" could be ambiguous. Maybe they're saying they don't claim it opens dark spots, but the structure of the sentence is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe \"koyu lekeleri açtığını söylemem\" means that they are not claiming that the cream opens dark spots. So perhaps the negative part is actually a neutral statement because they're not making a definitive claim about the dark spots. But the initial analysis might have misinterpreted it as a negative.\n\nAlternatively, if \"açtığını\" refers to the cream causing the dark spots to become more visible, then that's a negative effect. However, the user says \"söylemem,\" which could mean they are not stating that it does so. So maybe the sentiment is neutral because they're not making a clear positive or negative statement about the dark spots.\n\nBut considering the structure of the sentence: \"Cilt tonumu eşitlediğini fark ettim ama koyu lekeleri açtığını söylemem.\" The first part is positive, the second part is a contrast. If the user is saying that they noticed skin tone evenness but are not claiming it opens dark spots, then maybe the overall sentiment is neutral because there's both a positive and an unconfirmed point.\n\nHowever, in some contexts, \"açmak\" can mean to open or reveal, so if the cream is causing dark spots to become more visible, that's negative. But since the user says they don't claim it does, maybe they're uncertain. This makes the sentiment neutral because there's a mix of positive and unconfirmed aspects.\n\nSo the label should be NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

The words used are \"yumuşacık\" which means soft, and \"yoğun görünüm sağladı\" which translates to gave a dense or thick appearance. Both of these are positive attributes for hair products. People usually want their hair to be soft and look thicker, so the user is expressing satisfaction with the product's performance.\n\nI should check if there's any negative connotation here.

If someone says a knife isn't sharp, that's negative because it's not functioning as intended. But if they're talking about something else, maybe it's neutral. However, without more context, I have to go with the most straightforward interpretation.\n\nIn product reviews, for example, if a customer says \"Keskin değil\" about a knife or blade, they're likely expressing dissatisfaction.

The thumbs-up emoji 👍 also reinforces a positive sentiment.\n\nLooking for negative words or phrases. There's nothing here that indicates dissatisfaction. Words like \"beğendim\" (liked), \"hiç yok gibi hissettim\" (felt like there was none, implying effectiveness), and the emoji all point to a positive experience.

Yikamada kenarlarinin hepsi sokuldu\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the content. The user mentions \"penyesi çok iyi\" which translates to \"the pen is very good.\" That's a positive statement. However, there's an \"ama\" (but) followed by some numbers and a part about \"yikamada kenarlarinin hepsi sokuldu\". \n\nThe numbers 2.3 might be a typo or could refer to something like a product model or version. The phrase \"Yikamada kenarlarinin hepsi sokuldu\" is a bit unclear. \"Yikama\" could mean washing, and \"kenarlarinin hepsi sokuldu\" might mean that all the edges were pushed in or collapsed. Maybe they're talking about a product's edges getting damaged during washing.\n\nSo there's a positive part about the pen being good, but then a negative part about damage occurring. The user is pointing out a flaw despite the initial praise. In sentiment analysis, when there's both positive and negative elements, it can be tricky. However, the presence of \"ama\" (but) usually indicates that the following part is more significant or negative. \n\nThe main issue here seems to be the damage to the product, which would lean the overall sentiment towards negative. Even though they start with a positive comment, the problem mentioned might outweigh it. But I should check if the numbers 2.3 are relevant. Maybe it's referring to a specific model that had issues. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. \n\nIn Turkish, sometimes people use \"ama\" to contrast two points, but the overall sentiment depends on which part is stronger. Since the negative aspect here is about a product defect, which is a significant issue, I think the label should be NEGATIVE. The initial positive comment is there, but the problem mentioned is more critical.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEGATIVE\"}"

            "raw": "<think>\nOkay, let's analyze this text. The user wrote, \"Rengi güzel fakat dudaktaki duruşunu sevmedim.\" Translating that to English: \"The color is nice but I didn't like the way it sits on the lips.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the sentiment here. The sentence starts with a positive comment about the color being good. Then there's a contrast with \"fakat\" (but), followed by a negative statement about not liking how it sits on the lips.\n\nSo, there's both positive and negative elements. But in sentiment analysis, when there's a contradiction, we usually look at the overall tone. However, the instructions say to use only POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. \n\nThe user is expressing dissatisfaction with a specific aspect (how it sits on the lips) despite liking another aspect (color). Since the negative part is about a key feature (application on lips), which might be more critical for a product like lipstick, the overall sentiment leans negative. But I need to check if the presence of both positive and negative parts makes it neutral.\n\nWait, but in some cases, if one part is strongly negative and the other is just a minor positive, the overall could still be negative. However, the instruction examples show that even with a mix, like \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" (Okay for the price), it's neutral. But here, the user is explicitly stating dislike for a specific aspect. \n\nHmm. The example where a sentence has both positive and negative parts but ends up as neutral might be when the negatives are outweighed by positives or vice versa. However, in this case, the negative part is about a critical feature, so maybe it's more negative. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since there's a mix of sentiments, maybe it's neutral.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules: The user wants only POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL. If the text has both positive and negative elements without clear dominance, it might be considered NEUTRAL. But sometimes, the presence of a strong negative can make it NEGATIVE even with some positives.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral. So maybe when there's a mix but no clear dominant sentiment, it's neutral. However, here the user has a positive and a negative. The question is whether the overall sentiment is more negative or neutral.\n\nAlternatively, since the user didn't like a specific aspect (dudaktaki duruşunu), which might be crucial for a product, the negative part could dominate, making the label NEGATIVE. But I need to check if that's the case.\n\nAnother angle: The sentence structure uses \"fakat\" (but) to contrast the two parts. In such cases, sometimes the second part is more important. So the user didn't like how it sits on the lips despite liking the color. That might indicate a negative sentiment overall because the main issue (application) is not liked.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe in some contexts, mixed sentiments are neutral. However, given that the example with \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" is neutral, which has both positive and negative elements but ends up as neutral, perhaps here it's also neutral because there's a mix of opinions without clear dominance.\n\nWait, but the user explicitly says they didn't like something important (how it sits on lips), so maybe that's more significant. However, the instruction examples don't cover such cases. The example given was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is neutral because it's a balanced statement. Here, the user has both positive and negative but with a clear negative about a key feature.\n\nHmm. Maybe in this case, since there's a specific complaint, even though there's a positive part, the overall sentiment is NEGATIVE. But I need to be careful here. Alternatively, if the positive and negative are equally weighted, it might be neutral.\n\nBut how do we determine that? The user didn't specify any rules about mixed sentiments. The original instructions just say to use POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, or NEUTRAL based on the text. So perhaps in this case, since there's both, but no clear dominance, it's NEUTRAL. However, if the negative part is more impactful, then NEGATIVE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of a negative statement makes the whole sentiment negative. But that might not be accurate. For example, \"The product is good, but I didn't like the color.\" That would be mixed, so neutral?\n\nBut in some cases, people might consider the overall sentiment as negative if the main issue is not liked. However, without explicit rules on this, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nGiven that the user provided examples where mixed sentiments can lead to neutral (like \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is neutral), perhaps here, since there's both positive and negative aspects, even though one is more critical, it might still be considered NEUTRAL. But I'm not entirely sure. However, in the absence of clear rules on mixed sentiments, maybe the safest bet is to go with NEGATIVE because the user explicitly states a dislike for an important aspect (how it sits on lips), which could override the positive comment about color.\n\nBut again, this is subjective. The example given by the user was \"Fiyatına göre okey.\" which is neutral. So maybe in that case, even though there's a positive and negative part, it's considered neutral. Here, the same logic might apply: both positive and negative aspects are present, so NEUTRAL.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me think again. The user says \"Rengi güzel\" (color is nice) which is positive, but then \"dudaktaki duruşunu sevmedim\" (didn't like how it sits on the lips), which is negative. So two opposing sentiments. In such cases, if there's no clear dominance, the label would be NEUTRAL.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the user has both positive and negative points without one clearly outweighing the other. Therefore, the correct label here is NEUTRAL.\n</think>\n\n{\"label\": \"NEUTRAL\"}"

That's a positive point. But then there's a problem with charging. The user is frustrated because they can't determine where the issue lies—whether it's the cable or the port. This part is negative.\n\nNow, the challenge is to decide whether the overall sentiment is more positive, negative, or neutral. The user starts with a positive experience but ends with a complaint about a malfunctioning product. However, the main issue here is that the product isn't working as expected due to charging problems. Even though they're satisfied with some aspects, the core functionality (charging) is compromised. \n\nBut wait, the user says they \"kullandım memnun da kaldım\" which translates to \"I used it and was satisfied.\" So the initial experience was good. However, the charging issue is a significant problem that affects the product's usability. The fact that they couldn't resolve it adds to the frustration. \n\nIn sentiment analysis, if there are both positive and negative elements, but the negative part is about a critical function failing, it might tip the scale towards negative.

That part is positive. But then there's \"ancak\" which means \"however,\" indicating a contrast.

There's a mix, but the overall experience seems negative because despite liking the brand, the product didn't meet their expectations. However, the initial part is positive.
